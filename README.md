Swap the home screen, add a vocabulary trainer, remap every gesture: a
folder of text files is enough, no fork, no rebuild. PaperPaw runs as
firmware of its own on the Xteink X4 and X4 Pro, and as an app for
Android e-readers. Free and open source: no account, no ads, no
tracking.

> **Status: beta (0.5.0-beta.1), for testers and plugin developers.**
> The firmware for the Xteink X4 and X4 Pro runs on both readers and in
> the desktop emulator. It is a beta: expect rough edges, and keep a
> copy of your books. The plugin SDK is a beta too: it may still change
> before 1.0, and a plugin with code is rebuilt when a release raises
> the plugin interface. Please report problems in the
> [issues](https://github.com/hthoene/paperpaw/issues). It reads EPUB,
> FB2, Markdown, HTML, CBZ, plain text and XTC. It shares reading
> positions, bookmarks and highlights with KOReader, takes books from
> Calibre over Wi-Fi and from OPDS catalogs, and much more; see the
> [changelog](CHANGELOG.md). The app for Android e-readers is a beta
> too, as an APK on the [releases](https://github.com/hthoene/paperpaw/releases).

## Three ways in

| I just want to read | I want to tinker | I want to develop |
|---|---|---|
| Install it and open a book. Night mode, gestures and a home screen with your current book are there from the start, by touch or with buttons. **[Get it](#get-it)** | A plugin can be a folder of text files: a key map, new defaults, a theme, a translation. *Large print* is three files. **[Plugins without code](#plugins-without-code)** | A Rust crate against `paperpaw-sdk` adds screens, formats or services, or replaces the home screen outright. On the X4 it is a signed file from the plugin store. **[Writing plugins](docs/plugins.md)** |

## What it does

On the X4 and X4 Pro, some of these come as plugins from the store.

### Everything is a plugin

<img align="right" width="160" src="docs/images/readme/plugins.png" alt="A cat arranging puzzle pieces">

The core is a small kernel. The home screen, library, reader, menus, file
formats, themes, key maps and translations are plugins, and first-party
ones use exactly the same SDK as community plugins. Anything can be
added, replaced, reconfigured or removed. On the X4, a plugin with code
is a file from the plugin store, signed by its author, or one's own
build sent from a computer: no firmware rebuild.

<br clear="right">

### Wi-Fi set up with a phone

<img align="left" width="160" src="docs/images/readme/phone.png" alt="A cat tapping a phone beside an e-reader">

Join a network by scanning a code and typing the password on your phone.
Books go over from a phone or a computer, with or without a router, or
over the USB cable; Calibre sends them over Wi-Fi as to any wireless
reader. Nothing is written before you allow it on the device.

<br clear="left">

### Vocabulary

<img align="right" width="160" src="docs/images/readme/cards.png" alt="A cat looking at a flash card, a pile of cards beside it">

Every word you look up is kept with its sentence. Learn them as flash
cards, edit them on a phone, or bring an Anki deck along; a card that is
due can show while the reader sleeps.

<br clear="right">

### Reading goal

<img align="left" width="160" src="docs/images/readme/goal.png" alt="A content cat beside an open book and an alarm clock">

Minutes to read a day, and a cat on the home screen whose mood follows
today's reading: sad, so-so, content or happy.

<br clear="left">

### Small and simple

- **Runs in 262 KB of heap.** The Xteink X4 is an ESP32-C3 with 400 KB
  of RAM and no PSRAM. A test opens books in the emulator on every
  change. It fails if they take more than 85 % of that heap.
- **Simple by default.** Turn it on and keep reading. Every function is at
  most two steps away, and it works with buttons only or with touch.
- **One codebase, many devices.** Today: the Xteink X4 and X4 Pro, the
  desktop emulator, and as a beta Android e-readers such as Boox, in
  grayscale and colour e-ink. Planned: the Xteink X3, Kobo, Kindle
  (jailbroken), PocketBook and reMarkable. To add a device, see
  [docs/porting.md](docs/porting.md).

## Get it

PaperPaw replaces the firmware of the Xteink X4 and X4 Pro. Install the
beta from the browser at [paperpaw.org/flash](https://paperpaw.org/flash).
The flasher first saves the reader's own firmware, so you can go back.
Developers can build and flash it as
[shells/xteink](shells/xteink/README.md) describes.

The app for Android e-readers is on each
[release](https://github.com/hthoene/paperpaw/releases) as an APK, a beta
as well. [shells/android](shells/android/README.md) says how to install
it.

## How it's made

PaperPaw is a one-person project. Much of its code and documentation is
written with the help of an AI model (Claude, by Anthropic). Its maker
decides what goes in. CI runs over 4,000 tests, snapshot tests of the
screens and other checks on every change. Releases are built
reproducibly and tried on a real reader first. PaperPaw is in beta:
expect rough edges, and please report them in the issues. Wishes are
welcome too.
More at [paperpaw.org/about](https://paperpaw.org/about).

## Customisation at a glance

A plain text file (`paperpaw.ini`) on the device changes behaviour without
any programming:

```ini
[core]
language = de
full-refresh-interval = 8

[slots]
# Replace the home screen with any screen a plugin provides, here the library.
core.home = files.browser

[keymap.global]
# Bind any input to any action; `none` removes a binding.
long.page-forward = core.toggle-night-mode
tap.center = none
swipe.up = core.menu

[menus]
# Redefine any menu: which actions, in which order.
core.reader-menu = reader.font-larger, reader.font-smaller, core.toggle-night-mode, core.home

[plugins]
# Switch any plugin off by its id (or use Settings → Plugins).
some-plugin = off
```

Plugins contribute screens, actions, settings, key maps and translations
through the [`paperpaw-sdk`](crates/paperpaw-sdk) crate. See
[docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md) for the full extension model.

### Plugins without code

A folder with a few text files is a plugin too. Copy it into the `plugins`
folder of the device and restart, or send it from a computer with the
Wi-Fi transfer or over the USB cable. It shows up in *Settings →
Plugins*, where it can be switched off again; the store does not update
a plugin put in place so. These work on every device, including the
Xteink X4.

```text
plugins/large-print/
  plugin.ini     [plugin] id, name, description, version, formats
  i18n/*.ini     translations, also whole new languages
  keymap.ini     key bindings, as in paperpaw.ini
  settings.ini   new defaults for any setting, e.g. [core] font-size = 14
  menus.ini      entries added to menus or hidden from them
  actions.ini    actions made of up to 16 steps
  presets.ini    ready-made sets of settings
  marks.ini      words marked on book pages by patterns
  icons.ini      icons of actions and settings
  setup.ini      steps of the first-run setup
  styles.css     a stylesheet for books
  points/*.txt   lines for keyboard layouts and the About page
  fonts/*        fonts to read with: packs (.ppfp), or .ttf, .otf and .ttc
                 where those are drawn (not on the X4 and X4 Pro)
```

[docs/data-files.md](docs/data-files.md) describes every file.

[`samples/plugins/large-print`](samples/plugins/large-print) is a complete
example. Plugins with code are Rust crates using the SDK; on the X4 and
X4 Pro, those not built into the firmware are files from the plugin
store, signed by their authors, or one's own builds sent over USB or the
Wi-Fi transfer ([docs/usb-transfer.md](docs/usb-transfer.md)), with no
firmware rebuild. [Writing plugins](docs/plugins.md)
walks through [`samples/hello-plugin`](samples/hello-plugin/src/lib.rs), a
small one to start from.

## Try it in the emulator

Each release has the emulator ready to run for Windows, macOS and Linux,
on the [releases page](https://github.com/hthoene/paperpaw/releases). It
comes with `paperpaw-dev`. To build it yourself, you need a recent stable
[Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs). The required targets are installed
automatically from `rust-toolchain.toml`.

```bash
cargo run -p paperpaw-emulator -- --profile xteink-x4
```

```bash
cargo run -p paperpaw-emulator -- --list-profiles
```

Keys: `PageDown` or `Space` next page, `PageUp` previous page, arrow keys,
`Enter` confirm, `Esc` or `Backspace` back, `M` menu, `H` home, `P` power.
Hold a key for a long press. Holding `Enter` opens the menu on devices
without a menu button. The mouse acts as the touch screen: tap the left or
right edge to turn pages, the centre for the menu. `F2` shows refreshed
regions, `F3` switches the flash animation, `F12` saves a screenshot.

Devices with only two buttons (and Bluetooth page turners) can operate
everything with the *Two buttons* layout (`core.keymap-preset`): a short
press moves forward or back, a long press on forward confirms or opens the
menu, a long press on back goes back. Try it with
`--profile two-buttons`.

Settings changed in the UI are saved to `paperpaw.ini` in the library
folder, the same file you can edit by hand.

The emulator uses `samples/library` as the device storage; two
public-domain books are included as EPUB and TXT. Put your own `.epub` and
`.txt` files into
`samples/library/books` or point `--library` at any folder.

The emulator enforces each device's heap budget on the kernel. So memory
problems show up on the desktop before they show up on hardware.
`--heap-budget none` shows the real peak. `--trace-alloc 1024` lists the
large allocations behind it. `--heap-report` groups the live heap by call
site. `--trace` prints what drawing each frame asks of the storage, band
by band, as the X4 draws it. Headless runs produce screenshots for tests
and bug reports:

```bash
cargo run -p paperpaw-emulator -- --headless --profile boox-go-7 --set core.language=de --script "page-forward,long:page-forward" --screenshot out/go7.png
```
