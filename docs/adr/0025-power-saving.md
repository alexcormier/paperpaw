# 0025. Power saving: efficient by default, declared work, power modes

- Status: Accepted; implemented in the kernel, the SDK, the power plugin
  and the first-party plugins, and the base fixes in the X4 and X4 Pro
  shell; the shells' part (`Io::Power`, `KernelBuilder::power`) still
  to come
- Date: 2026-10-20; jobs, timers by key, HTTP and servers (G2 of
  the SDK gaps) folded in the same day

## Context

Battery is precious, most of all on the X4 (650 mAh) and the X4 Pro
(1,100 mAh). Plugins sync with services (KOReader positions, statistics,
Readwise, Joplin, OPDS catalogs), widgets show weather and news, rules
run actions at times and on events, and the radio is switched on for all
of this by the `wifi` plugin ([ADR 0016](0016-network-and-wifi.md)).

PaperPaw should be very frugal **by default**, without getting in the
reader's way: a position read on the X4 must be on the phone when the
reader picks it up, not an hour later. Saving should come from doing
the same work at better moments and with less waste, not from doing
less of what the reader wants. Where readers want to trade features for
battery, one switch should do it, for every plugin, including those
written by others.

### Where the energy goes today

Read from the code on 2026-10-20 (a survey of the shells, the kernel and
every first-party plugin). Numbers marked *measured* are in the
CHANGELOG or the ADRs; numbers marked *derived* are arithmetic from the
chips' data sheets, not measured on a device. The battery plugin logs
what is needed, but no analysis of its logs has been written down yet.

Two facts frame everything. On battery, sleeping on the X4 is switching
off (D2): nothing runs while the device sleeps, and every wake is a full
start. So only awake time costs energy, and work can only happen while
the device is awake. And the ESP32's states differ by a factor of a
hundred: light sleep about 0.1 mA (*measured*), the CPU awake at full
speed about 20 mA on the X4 (*measured*), the radio receiving about
85 mA and sending up to 300 mA (data sheet).

1. **The radio, while on.** The shell never sets the radio's power
   saving (esp-radio defaults to none, so it listens all the time), and
   the main loop does not light-sleep while the radio is on
   (`shells/xteink/src/firmware.rs`, `battery = !self.network.radio_on()
   && …`); it busy-waits in 10 ms steps. After the last request the
   radio stays on for `wifi.idle-off` (1 min by default). A connection
   scans twice (the plugin's scan, then the join's), waits for SNTP on
   the X4 (no clock chip), and takes 1.3 to 2.7 s for TLS (*measured*,
   ADR 0017). One small background request costs roughly 70 s at around
   100 mA, about 2 mAh (*derived*): on the order of one to two hours of
   reading with light sleep.
2. **Each plugin decides on its own when to reach the network.**
   kosync, on by default, pulls the position when a book opens and on
   every wake and pushes it when a book closes and before sleep, each
   time switching the radio on by itself (`plugins/kosync/src/lib.rs`).
   Weather and kosync's page-turn push check by hand whether the radio
   is on anyway (`radio_on_anyway`, `online()`); the others do not. The
   push before sleep probably never leaves the X4: the kernel holds it
   until online, and the firmware switches off first.
3. **The X4 Pro's front light** blocks light sleep (its PWM stops in a
   light sleep), so with the light above 0 % the ESP32-S3 spins at
   240 MHz the whole time, on top of the LEDs' current.
4. **Display refreshes.** A fast refresh takes about 0.5 s, the X4's
   half refresh against ghosting 1.6 s, a full one 3.5 s (*measured*).
   The panel's power is never switched off after a fast refresh
   (`power_off` is always `false`). While the panel refreshes, the CPU
   spins on its BUSY line. An idle home screen redraws its status line
   every minute without asking for a mode; the kernel takes `Partial`,
   which counts towards the periodic half refresh: one refresh a minute
   and a half refresh every six minutes until the device sleeps (read
   from the code, not yet seen on a device).
5. **The CPU while awake.** The clock is fixed at the maximum
   (`CpuClock::max()`): 160 MHz on the X4, 240 MHz on the X4 Pro. On
   battery it light-sleeps at most 30 ms at a time (the buttons are read
   on each wake): about 33 wakes a second. Counting a book's pages after
   opening runs in 2 ms steps, too short to sleep in.
6. **Every wake is a start**: the SD card mounted, the book reopened, a
   half refresh, kosync's pull, SNTP on the X4.
7. **Small**: the SD card written 2 s after each change, the battery
   plugin's line a minute, timers on their own.

### How others do it

- **Android** lets apps declare background work instead of running it
  (WorkManager, JobScheduler): constraints (network, charging, battery
  not low), a *flex* window instead of a time, unique names that replace
  each other. The system runs many apps' work on one wake, and in
  **Doze** only in rare *maintenance windows*. **Battery Saver** defers
  background work further, may turn on the dark theme, is switched from
  a quick settings tile, by battery level or by a routine, and turns off
  while charging. Apps read `isPowerSaveMode()` and get a broadcast when
  it changes.
- **iOS Low Power Mode** pauses background refresh, mail fetch and
  downloads, dims the display and slows the CPU; the battery icon turns
  yellow; it offers itself at 20 % and switches off at 80 % while
  charging. Background tasks (`BGTaskScheduler`) give only an earliest
  time; *discretionary* transfers are sent when it suits the system.
- **Kindle and Kobo** quote battery life "with wireless off"; their
  levers are airplane mode, sleep and power-off timers, the front light
  and fewer full refreshes. KOReader turns Wi-Fi on when an action
  needs it (or asks) and off when done.
- **Batching**: setting up the link (scan, join, DHCP, TLS) costs far
  more than the data. A study of phones found Wi-Fi scan and join cost
  five times a 50 KB transfer; batching with deadlines saved 35 to 52 %
  for mail and news.

What an e-reader on an ESP32 gains most from, in order: sleeping between
interactions (a factor of a hundred), the radio off unless needed and
never idling while connected (a factor of ten to a hundred), fewer link
setups by doing all network work together at the right moments, the
front light, then the CPU clock and refreshes (percent).

## Decision

Three layers, each building on the one before:

1. **Efficient by default**: the shells, the kernel and the first-party
   plugins waste nothing in any mode.
2. **Declared work**: plugins say what they need done and by when; the
   kernel decides when, and does it together with everything else, at
   moments that cost little. This replaces timers of plugins
   (`Command::Schedule`) and is the only way background work reaches the
   network.
3. **Power modes** change only the limits of declared work and a few
   settings (deadlines longer, optional work off, the light capped), by
   hand, by battery level or by a rule.
4. **Per plugin**, the reader may switch a plugin's network off, or let
   it keep Normal's limits in Saving, explicitly and visibly; the
   default follows the mode.

Throughout, two rules hold. **Nothing nags the reader**: background
work never asks and never notifies; quiet reading is why people own
such a device. And **nothing is refused silently to the plugin**: it
always learns what happened to its work or request, why, and when it
may try again, and the kernel does not let it try in a tight loop.

### 1. Efficient by default

Part of every mode, each change measured with the battery plugin before
and after (the plugin first gains what it lacks for this: radio time,
connections and requests per plugin, and the mode in each line):

- **The radio**: modem power saving while connected; light sleep with
  the radio on where esp-radio allows it; one scan per connection (the
  join uses the plugin's scan, or the channel of the network joined
  last); off at once after background work that no reader watched, and
  after `wifi.idle-off` (1 min) only after the reader's own use, when
  the next page of a catalog may follow.
- **The panel**: light sleep (or a timed nap of the waveform's length)
  while it refreshes, instead of spinning on BUSY; its power switched
  off after a fast refresh once nothing follows for a moment (checked to
  look the same).
- **The front light (X4 Pro)**: kept lit through light sleep (LEDC on a
  clock that keeps running in light sleep; to be tried on the S3), so
  reading with the light costs the LEDs and nothing more.
- **No idle redraws**: a screen redraws on a timer only what visibly
  changed, always as `Fast`, never counting towards the half refresh.
  The home screen's status line and clocks follow this.
- **The CPU**: page counting and other work that may wait run as
  declared work when the device is idle (below), in steps long enough
  to sleep between.
- **Network at natural moments**: first-party plugins declare their
  work (below), so that a reading session costs one short connection
  when it starts and one when it ends, whatever is installed.

### 2. Declared work

`paperpaw_sdk::work` adds `Work`: something a plugin wants done, with
what it needs and by when. When it is time, the kernel emits the work's
event with its parameters (as `Command::Schedule` did), and the plugin
does it then.

```rust
// Progress: pushed at the next natural moment, at the latest in 30 min.
out.push(Command::Work(
    Work::network(PUSH)            // needs the network
        .expected()                // the reader counts on it
        .within(Duration::from_secs(30 * 60))
        .at_moments(Moments::BOOK_CLOSED | Moments::SLEEP | Moments::ONLINE),
));
// Weather: whenever the radio is on anyway, at most once an hour.
out.push(Command::Work(
    Work::network(FETCH).optional().every(Duration::from_secs(3600)),
));
// The rules' "every day at 22:00": a time, exactly (was Command::Schedule).
out.push(Command::Work(Work::at(TIME, at_22).with(params)));
```

What a work says:

- **its id** (an event of the plugin) and, where one event stands for
  several works, a **key** (`key("rule-3")`): declaring the same id and
  key again replaces it, so a plugin need not track what it declared;
  `Command::CancelWork(id, key)` takes it back (no key: all of that
  id);
- **what it needs**: nothing, the network, or the device charging
  (`charging()`, e.g. a large download of covers);
- **how much the reader counts on it**: `expected()` (a position, an
  export the reader sent: it will be done, at the latest by its
  deadline) or `optional()` (weather, news, a catalog refreshed: done
  when it is cheap, left out when it is not);
- **when**: not before (`after`), at the latest (`within`; none means
  only when it is cheap, never on its own account), or exactly (`at`, a
  time: what `Command::Schedule` was); and `every`, to declare it again
  after each run;
- **at which moments it may run**: `Moments`, see below; all of them
  when not said.

**The kernel runs work** whose *after* has passed:

- at a **natural moment** it may run at: `WAKE` (the device started or
  woke), `BOOK_OPENED`, `BOOK_CLOSED`, `SLEEP` (going to sleep),
  `ONLINE` (the radio is on anyway, for the reader or for other work),
  `CHARGING` (plugged in) and `IDLE` (no input for a while, the screen
  still on);
- when its **deadline** comes: then, if it needs the network, it is the
  one thing that may switch the radio on by itself, and it takes along
  everything else that needs the network and whose *after* has passed;
- at its **time**, for work with an exact time.

So the network is set up once for everything due: one connection on
waking (kosync's pull, the weather, the news, an export waiting), one on
going to sleep (the push, the statistics), and none in between unless a
deadline comes. **Going to sleep** is to wait for the work running then,
for at most about 15 s (the sleep screen is already shown, so the
reader does not wait), before switching off, and network work not done
is to be written down and due at the next wake (the X4 does not know how
long it slept). Both need the shells' part and come with it; until
then a plugin declares again at the start what it still has to do.

**A run** lasts as long as the requests made while handling the work's
event, and the requests made while handling their answers, are not
answered; the kernel knows them, so a plugin need not say when it is
done. While a run needs the network, the radio stays on; once no run
and no reader needs it, the radio goes off.

**What the reader asks for is not work.** A request made while the
kernel handles the reader's input (a catalog opened, *Sync now*) goes
out at once and switches the radio on, as today. A request outside
both (an older plugin, an action run by a rule) is treated as expected
work due at once with a deadline of `NETWORK_WAIT_MS` (30 s): the same
as today in Normal, and limited by the mode like any other work. So
plugins written before this keep working, and the priority of a request
is not a separate concept: it is whether the reader waits (input), or
what the work declares.

**One model, not two.** `Command::Schedule` becomes `Work::at`: a time,
needing nothing, run exactly. The kernel keeps one queue of work (small:
an id, parameters and a few times each; at most 8 per plugin) and wakes
for the earliest of its times and deadlines. Screen timers
(`Cx::wake_at`) stay what they are: the open screen's own frame clock,
gone with the screen. The **rules** (C5) declare their times as exact
work, and their triggers are the same moments the kernel knows (a book
opened or closed, waking, going to sleep, charging), with one more,
*Wi-Fi came on*. An action a rule runs that reaches the network is
work like any other: "at 7:00: sync the catalogs" syncs at 7:00 if the
radio is on or the deadline allows, in Saving at the next connection.

**The `wifi` plugin** keeps deciding the radio ([ADR 0016](0016-network-and-wifi.md)):
`core.network-wanted` now says whether a reader waits or which work is
due, and in Normal and Saving the plugin switches on for either,
silently, as today. It no longer needs retry rounds for work that can
wait: the kernel declares it due again.

### Jobs, timers, HTTP and servers: the same model

The SDK gaps review (G2) asked for background jobs, timers that can be
taken back, more of HTTP, and servers shared by plugins. They are parts
of declared work, not a second model:

- **Jobs are work in steps.** Long work (installing a plugin, syncing
  OPDS catalogs, walking the library for its catalog, counting a book's
  pages) registers a step function for its id,
  `Registrar::add_work(WorkSpec::new(id, title, step))`, and is
  declared like any other work. When it runs, the kernel calls `step`
  instead of emitting the event, again and again while it says
  `Step::Continue` (or `Step::Progress(done, of)`), each time after the
  frame is drawn and only when no input waits, so the device answers at
  once and can sleep between steps; `Step::Wait(at)` and
  `Step::WaitFor(event)` (e.g. its request's reply) pause it, `Done`
  ends it, `Failed` declares it again after the backoff. A step should
  take a few milliseconds. `Env::work(id)` gives its state and progress
  for the plugin's page, `events::WORK_CHANGED` tells such a page when
  that changes (at most once a second); the title shows on the Power
  page and in the battery view. Work without a step function is
  simply its event, as above.
- **Timers are work at a time**, keyed: `Work::at(id, time).key(k)`,
  taken back with `CancelWork`. One event may have as many timers as
  keys (a rule each), which `Command::Schedule` could not.
- **Across starts** the kernel keeps the power mode worn, with the
  values of it the reader took back (on the X4 every wake is a start).
  Work kept across starts by a mark of its own comes with the waiting
  before sleep (above).
- **HTTP requests** get what work needs of them: a `timeout` (30 s by
  default, the connection and TLS counted), the headers a plugin wants
  back (`want_headers`, opt-in; `HttpReply::headers`), a `max_body` for
  answers kept in memory that defaults by the device's memory
  (`MemoryClass`: 64 KiB on the X4, 1 MiB elsewhere; larger answers go
  to a file, `save_to`), and a body of bytes. `Command::CancelHttp`
  takes back a plugin's requests with one reply event; cancelling a
  work cancels the requests of its run. Every request is answered once:
  with the answer, or with status 0 and a `Refusal` (`Cancelled`,
  `Offline`, `NetworkOff`, …). Helpers for multipart bodies written to a
  file and for cookies come with the SDK's `web`; TLS sockets and
  websockets are for a later decision.
- **Servers are the reader's connection.** One server owned by the
  kernel takes routes of any plugin (`Registrar::add_web_route(RouteSpec
  { prefix, event, title })`: transfer, typing on the phone, and what
  community plugins add share one port and one radio). A plugin's own
  server (`Command::Serve`) lives as long as its screen or until
  stopped (`lifetime`). A running server keeps the radio on and the
  device awake, as now, shows the status line's power mark as
  *serving*, and work held back rides along on its connection. In
  Saving and Offline a server left running stops after 10 minutes
  without a request (`core.serve-idle`), so a forgotten transfer page
  does not empty the battery.
- **Limits by memory**: works per plugin (8 on the X4, 32 elsewhere),
  requests at once and `max_body` follow `MemoryClass`.

### Quiet: background work never asks, never notifies

Part of the SDK's contract: **a plugin's background work cannot raise
anything over reading.** The kernel tells apart what follows from the
reader's input (the handler of an input or of an action the reader
ran, a screen the reader opened, and the replies to requests made
there) from everything else (declared work and its replies, events
such as a book opened, timers, rules). From everything else:

- `Command::Notify` is not shown: it becomes the plugin's **note**, the
  last one kept per plugin (with its time), written to the battery
  log, and shown where the reader looks on purpose: the plugin's own
  page, the Power page and the battery view ("Last sync failed 10:42,
  will try again at 11:12");
- refusals, held work and failures are never shown as a notice or a
  toast either; they are in `Env::work` and the same places;
- a plugin may show its own state on its own screens, as it likes.

Automatic switches levels silently: only the status line's power mark
changes. In Normal and Saving, Wi-Fi comes on for what the reader asks
for without a question. Answers to the reader's own actions may notify
as before ("Sync done" after *Sync progress*).

### Refused, held back, failed: always said, never in a loop

Every request and every declared work ends in an answer the plugin can
act on. `paperpaw_sdk::work` defines it once for both:

```rust
pub struct Refusal {
    pub reason: Reason,
    pub retry: Retry,
}
pub enum Reason {
    Offline,       // the mode holds network work back
    NetworkOff,    // the reader switched this plugin's network off
    NotDeclared,   // the plugin's manifest does not say it uses the network
    Saving,        // the mode defers it to a cheaper moment
    NoNetwork,     // no known network, or joining failed
    Sleeping,      // the device switched off before it was done
    TooOften,      // the plugin asked again too soon (see below)
}
pub enum Retry {
    After(Instant),    // not before then
    At(Moments),       // at the next of these moments
    WhenAllowed,       // when the mode or the reader allows it; told by an event
    Never,             // not without the reader changing something
}
```

- **A request** (`Command::Http`, `Connect`, `Serve`) that does not go
  out is answered as today (`status 0`) and its reply carries the
  refusal (`HttpReply::refused`). One that waits for a cheaper moment
  is not answered until it goes out or its wait ends; then it is
  answered with the refusal.
- **Declared work** is never dropped: held back by the mode, it stays
  in the queue and runs when allowed. Only when it can never run
  (`NetworkOff`, `NotDeclared`) does the kernel take it out and emit
  `core.work-refused` to the plugin, with its id and the refusal.
  `Env::work(id)` tells a plugin where a work stands (`due`, `held`
  with the reason, `running`), so its page can say "Waiting for the
  next connection" or "Held: Offline mode" instead of guessing.
- **When it is allowed again** (the mode changes, the reader switches
  the network back on, a connection comes) the kernel emits
  `core.work-allowed`; work in the queue simply runs.
- **A request that went out and failed** (a server error, a time-out)
  is the plugin's to retry, by declaring the work again with
  `Work::retry(attempt)`: after 30 s, then doubling up to 6 h, with a
  little randomness so devices do not all return at once.

**No retry storms.** A plugin cannot make the kernel spend energy by
insisting:

- a request refused for a reason is refused again at once, without
  any I/O, while that reason holds and before its `Retry`, with the
  reason `TooOften`; such refusals are counted per plugin and shown in
  the battery view and the log;
- declaring work again replaces it (same id), so a loop cannot grow
  the queue; a plugin has at most 8 works;
- **only a deadline switches the radio on, and at most once in
  `core.work.min-gap` (15 min) per plugin**; a plugin whose deadlines
  come sooner shares the next connection instead. The reader's own
  requests are not limited.

### 3. Power levels and modes

`paperpaw_sdk::power` adds `PowerLevel`, three steps plugins may read
for what declared work does not cover (a widget's look, a reader's
page counting): **Normal**, **Saving**, **Offline**. `Env::power` gives
the level and the mode in use (`Power { level, mode, automatic }`);
`core.power-changed` is emitted when either changes. Most plugins never
need it: declaring work with the right limits is enough.

What a level does to declared work, in the kernel:

| | Normal | Saving | Offline |
|-|--------|--------|---------|
| expected work, deadline | as declared | four times as long | held, none runs on its own |
| optional work | when cheap | only at `ONLINE` and `CHARGING` | not run |
| requests the reader makes | at once | at once | refused (`Offline`); a screen opened for the network offers to go online, once, inline |
| radio after background work | off at once | off at once | stays off |
| work held back | | | waits silently; runs on the next connection the reader makes, or when the mode changes |

These are settings (`core.work.stretch`, `core.work.optional`,
`core.work.network`), so a mode is a set of setting values, nothing
more.

**Offline and the reader.** Background and declared work never asks in
Offline: it waits silently and runs on the next connection the reader
makes. A question appears only when the reader actively opens
something that needs the network (the store, Calibre, Wi-Fi transfer,
an OPDS catalog): that screen shows it once, inline in its own layout
and not as a pop-up over the page, "Offline mode. Go online for this?"
with *Go online* and *Not now* (`ui::offline_offer`, the same for every
plugin). *Go online* sends `Command::GoOnline`: network for that screen
until it closes, and the work held back rides along on the same
connection. A request the reader makes elsewhere in Offline (an action
such as *Sync progress*) is refused with `Offline`, and its plugin may
say so in answer to that action.

**A mode** is a level plus a set of setting values, worn while the mode
is in use. Four are built in:

| Mode | Level | Values it brings (each editable) |
|------|-------|----------------------------------|
| **Normal** | Normal | none |
| **Saving** | Saving | the work limits above; the front light at most 50 %; sleep after at most 5 min; the CPU at 80 MHz outside drawing, decoding and TLS; the buttons read every 60 ms instead of 30 |
| **Offline** | Offline | the work limits above; the front light at most 30 %; sleep after at most 5 min; the CPU as in Saving |
| **Automatic** | chosen | Saving below `power.saving-below` (20 %), Offline below `power.offline-below` (10 %), Normal again 5 % above each, and Normal while charging |

**Mode values are a layer, not a change.** Wearing a mode puts its
values over the reader's own (a layer in `Settings`, read after a
preview, before the book's scope and the stored value); leaving it
takes the layer away, and the reader's own values are there as before.
Nothing is written. A number may be a limit instead of a value
(`x4.frontlight <= 50`): the reader's own value is kept below it. If
the reader changes a setting the mode holds, their change wins until
the mode changes.

**Anyone can add modes.** A mode is a preset of the kind
`core.power-mode` ([presets](../../crates/paperpaw-sdk/src/presets.rs))
with its level among its values: built in (`Registrar::add_presets`,
costing next to no memory), brought by a plugin, or by a data plugin's
`presets.ini`:

```ini
[commute]
kind = core.power-mode
name = Commute
description = Offline, a dim light, sleep after 3 minutes.
power.level = offline
core.sleep-after <= 3
x4.frontlight <= 10
```

Readers make their own on the device: *Save as new mode* takes the
level of the mode in use and the values they choose.

**Modes and reading profiles** (C6, the `profiles` plugin) are one
building block with two uses. A profile is how reading looks ("Large
print", "Night"): it is *applied*, its values written into the reader's
settings, and stays until changed. A mode is how much energy to spend:
it is *worn*, a layer taken away again, and Automatic changes it on its
own. For the reader they stay two things on two axes that combine
freely (Night in Saving); one concept would let Automatic change a
reader's font at 20 %. They share the format (presets), the editing on
the device (*save as*, rename, remove) and the ways to reach them
(rules, buttons, the menu editor). A profile may name a mode to wear
with it (`power.mode = core.offline`), so "Night" can mean "dim, warm
and offline" with one tap.

### Per plugin: its network, and an exemption from the mode

Every plugin's row in the plugin manager, and its line in the
battery view, offers two settings, made by the kernel for each plugin
whose manifest says it uses the network:

- **Network**: on (default) or off. Off, the kernel refuses the
  plugin's requests, servers and sockets (`NetworkOff`, `Retry::Never`)
  and its network work, and the plugin does what it can offline.
- **In saving modes**: *follow the mode* (default), *as in Normal*
  (its work keeps Normal's deadlines and optional work in Saving), or
  *only when I ask* (no background network at all, in every mode).

The exemption is part of the work model, not a way around it: an
exempt plugin's work still waits for its moments and its deadlines,
still shares connections, still has the minimum gap; only the limits of
the mode are those of Normal. It applies to Saving and to the reader's
own modes, not to Offline, which stays offline for everything. These
are settings like any other, so a mode may hold them: a reader who
wants only one plugin online makes a mode of their own (Saving, the
other plugins *only when I ask*). Only the reader sets them; a plugin
may explain why it would like an exemption and open its own page (the
settings slot with its group), but not set it. The Power page lists the exempt plugins, and the battery view
shows each plugin's cost (radio time, connections it caused, requests,
refusals) beside the two settings, so an exemption is never invisible.

The manifest says what a plugin uses (`Manifest::uses`, the
declaration ADR 0024 shows before installing): a plugin that does not
declare the network gets no network setting and its requests are
refused (`NotDeclared`), so the declaration stays honest. For native
plugins this is enforced on every path the SDK offers; as ADR 0024
says, it is a promise checked by review, not a fence against code that
goes around the SDK.

### The shells

The kernel tells the shell the level and the shell's own values of the
mode (`Io::Power`); a shell says what it can change
(`KernelBuilder::power`, read as `Env::capabilities.power`: radio, CPU
clock, button reading, front light, a system saver), so that the
settings show only what applies there. The X4 shell applies the CPU
clock and the button interval; everything in *Efficient by default*
applies in every mode. Android follows the system's Battery Saver as
the shell's saver (Automatic is Saving while it is on), runs declared
work while PaperPaw is in front, and leaves Wi-Fi and the CPU to the
system. The emulator offers the levels and a battery that can be set,
so all of it can be tried without hardware.

### First-party plugins

| Plugin | Declares | Normal | Saving | Offline |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| `kosync` | pull: expected, at `WAKE`, `BOOK_OPENED`, within 10 s; push: expected, at `BOOK_CLOSED`, `SLEEP`, `ONLINE`, within 30 min; both silent | position fresh on opening, on the other device as soon as the X4 is put away; a newer position elsewhere offered when the reader opens the book, as today | the same moments; deadlines 40 s and 2 h | held, silently |
| `weather` | fetch: optional, every `weather.every` (1 h) | when the radio is on anyway (as today) | at `ONLINE` and `CHARGING` | the last forecast, marked as old |
| `news` | refresh: optional, every few hours | at the next connection | at `ONLINE` and `CHARGING` | the last headlines |
| `stats` | sync: expected after reading, at `SLEEP`, `ONLINE`, within a day | at the next sleep | the same, within four days | held |
| `readwise`, `joplin` | an export: expected, within 30 min | at the next moment | within 2 h | held until online |
| `opds`, `update` | syncs and checks started by rules: expected, within an hour | at the next connection | within four hours | held |
| `update` | while an update waits for its plugins, the question again once a day: expected, not before a day, within two days | at the next connection | within eight days | held |
| `calibre`, `transfer`, `browser`, `store`, `opds` (browsing) | nothing: the reader is there | at once | at once | the inline offer on opening |
| `reader` | page counting: needs nothing, at `IDLE`, `CHARGING` | when idle | when idle | when idle |
| `home`, `widgets` | nothing; redraw only what changed | | clocks in whole minutes | as Saving |
| `wifi` | nothing; follows `core.network-wanted`, silently | | | off; on after *Go online* |
| `rules` | its times as exact work | | | |
| `battery` | measures; its log gains the mode, radio time, connections and requests per plugin | | | |

### How a reader sees and switches it

- **Quick panel**: *Power* as four segments (Normal, Saving, Offline,
  Automatic), the same by buttons and by touch.
- **Status item** `core.status.power`: a small leaf next to the battery,
  shown only when not in Normal (as the yellow battery on iOS), placed
  on the home screen's and the reader's lines by default, drawn empty in
  Normal so the lines stay calm.
- **Settings › System › Power**: the mode, Automatic's two levels and
  *Normal while charging*, the list of modes with what each changes,
  the reader's own modes and *Save as new mode*. The setting
  `core.power-mode` (`auto` or a mode's id) is an ordinary choice, so
  rules, buttons and the menu editor reach it like any other.
- **Nothing else**: no notice when Automatic switches, no prompt about
  Wi-Fi while reading; in Offline only the inline offer on a screen the
  reader opened for the network.

### Where it lives

- **SDK**: `work` (`Work`, `Moments`, `Command::Work`,
  `Command::CancelWork`, `Command::GoOnline`, `Refusal`, `Reason`,
  `Retry`, `Env::work`, `events::WORK_REFUSED`, `events::WORK_ALLOWED`,
  `events::WORK_CHANGED`; jobs: `WorkSpec`, `Step`,
  `Registrar::add_work`), HTTP (`HttpRequest::{timeout, want_headers,
  max_body}`, `HttpReply::headers`, `Command::CancelHttp`), servers
  (`Registrar::add_web_route`, `Serve`'s lifetime),
  `ui::offline_offer`, `HttpReply::refused`,
  `Manifest::uses`, `power` (`PowerLevel`, `Power`), `Env::power`,
  `events::POWER_CHANGED`, the settings' mode layer and limits.
  `Command::Schedule` is removed in favour of `Work::at` (its callers
  are the rules, weather and wifi plugins). A minor SDK version
  ([ADR 0020](0020-sdk-compatibility.md)), noted in the CHANGELOG and
  the SDK's API file.
- **Kernel**: the queue of work, the moments, runs and their requests,
  the levels' limits, the mode layer, holding sleep for running work,
  writing down what was not done, the per-plugin network and exemption
  settings, refusals and the limits against retrying too often.
- **A new `power` plugin**, replaceable like `wifi`: the built-in modes,
  Automatic, the settings page, the quick panel entry and the status
  item. Mechanism in the kernel and the shells, policy in a
  plugin, as in ADR 0016.

### Defaults for beginners

Efficient by default, and Automatic: Saving below 20 % (the level at
which PaperPaw already calls the battery low), Offline below 10 %,
Normal while charging. A beginner never has to find the setting: the
device saves anyway, saves more when the battery runs low, shows a
leaf while it does, and goes back by itself when charged, all without a
word. Nothing they use stops working in Saving; in Offline, a screen
opened for the network offers to go online.

### Expected gain

Rough, *derived* from the data sheets and the survey, to be measured
with the battery plugin before and after each step:

- **A reading session** today costs a connection for kosync's pull on
  waking, another for its push on closing a book, each with a 1 min
  tail without modem sleep or light sleep: about 2 mAh each, several a
  day, a noticeable share of 650 mAh. With declared work and the radio
  fixed: two short connections a session (waking, sleeping), each
  carrying everything due, a few tenths of a mAh each. The position is
  on the other device as soon as the X4 sleeps.
- **The X4 Pro with the light on**: keeping light sleep could cut the
  awake current by an order of magnitude.
- **Refreshes and the CPU**: no idle redraws, no spinning during
  refreshes and the panel's power off save a little on every page;
  Saving's slower clock and button reading about a quarter of the awake
  current outside drawing.
- **Saving and Offline** then add the last part: no optional network,
  longer deadlines, the light capped, no radio at all at the end of the
  battery, so the book can be finished.

## Consequences

- PaperPaw is frugal without a mode; the modes trade features for
  battery, and nothing a reader chose is overwritten by them.
- Plugins say what they need and by when, and get the network at the
  cheapest moment; none needs `radio_on_anyway` or its own timers and
  retries. Background work of all plugins shares one connection.
- One queue in the kernel for timers and work instead of a timer list
  and per-plugin policies; rules use the same model.
- Progress sync is on time where it matters: when a book is opened and
  when the X4 is put away.
- Going to sleep may take up to about 15 s longer, unseen behind the
  sleep screen; work not done is due at the next wake.
- `Command::Schedule` goes; its callers move to `Work::at`. Install,
  OPDS sync, the catalog walk and page counting become jobs instead of
  each stepping itself; servers of plugins share one.
- A plugin always knows why its work did not run and when to try
  again; a misbehaving plugin costs a refusal, not a connection, and
  shows up in the battery view.
- Readers can keep one plugin eager or silence one entirely, and see
  what that costs; the default stays saving.
- Manifests must declare the network, or their requests are refused.
- Gains are claimed only after the battery plugin has measured them.

## Decisions on what was left open

Decided on 2026-10-20. Where a measurement on the device comes first,
the value here is the starting point and the measurement may change it.

1. **Modes and profiles** are two things for the reader on one building
   block (presets, the same editing), and a profile may name a mode.
2. **Automatic**: Saving below 20 % (the existing *battery low* level),
   Offline below 10 %, Normal 5 % above each and while charging;
   switching is silent, only the status line's power mark changes.
3. **Offline and the reader**: background and declared work never asks
   and never notifies; it waits and runs on the next connection the
   reader makes. Only a screen the reader opens for the network offers
   to go online, once, inline. In Normal and Saving, Wi-Fi comes on
   silently on demand.
4. **The built-in modes** bring the values in the table above.
   *Measure* the sleep timer (every start on the X4 costs a half
   refresh, a mount and the wake's connection) and the light caps.
5. **Saving does not change looks**, apart from the light cap and
   clocks in whole minutes.
6. **Requests outside input and outside declared work** are expected
   work due at once with the old 30 s deadline, limited by the mode.
7. **The quick panel** shows the four built-in modes as segments; the
   reader's own modes are on the Power page and actions for buttons and
   rules, with a row *More modes* in the panel only when there are any.
8. **Charging**: Normal while charging; Automatic picks up again when
   unplugged.
9. **Timers with slack**: declared work replaces `Command::Schedule`;
   the rules keep exact times through `Work::at`.
10. **Going to sleep** waits for running work for about 15 s, the radio
    off at once afterwards. *Measure* a connection and a kosync push on
    the X4 once the radio is fixed (the firmware logs `wifi: join took`).
11. **kosync** pulls within 10 s of opening and pushes on closing or
    sleeping, at the latest after 30 min of reading, silently; a newer
    position elsewhere is offered only when the reader opens the book,
    inline, as today. *Measure* a session's cost against today.
12. **The base fixes** are all done, each kept only if it looks the
    same and measures better. *Measure* modem sleep and light sleep
    with the radio on, the panel's power off after fast refreshes, the
    front light through light sleep on the S3.
13. **A plugin's network** can be switched off on its row in the plugin
    manager and in the battery view, on by default; a plugin that does
    not declare the network in its manifest gets none (`NotDeclared`).
    Refusals are never shown over reading (see *Quiet*).
14. **Exemptions**: three choices (*follow the mode*, *as in Normal*,
    *only when I ask*), set only by the reader, for Saving and the
    reader's own modes, not for Offline; listed on the Power page, their
    cost in the battery view.
15. **Refusals and retries**: one `Refusal` for requests and work,
    held work kept in the queue, `TooOften` refused without I/O, a
    backoff from 30 s to 6 h, at most one deadline-forced connection per
    plugin in 15 min; failures of background work only in the plugin's
    note, its page, the Power page and the battery view. *Measure*
    whether 15 min is right once a connection's cost is known.
16. **A plugin may not exempt itself**: it may explain and open its own
    settings page, never set the exemption, never ask by a dialog of
    its own.
