# Writing plugins

Everything PaperPaw shows and does comes from plugins: the home screen,
the reader, the library, the menus, the settings, even the keyboard. The
kernel only hosts them. A plugin you write can do anything these do, and
replace any of them.

There are two kinds:

- **Data plugins**: a folder with a `plugin.ini` and data files, no code.
  They bring translations (also whole new languages), key maps, new
  defaults for any setting, presets (themes, pictures for the sleep
  screen), menus and actions made of steps, marks in the text,
  stylesheets and fonts.
  They work on every device as they are; see
  [Plugins without code](#plugins-without-code).
- **Code plugins**: Rust crates against the SDK (`paperpaw-sdk`). They
  bring screens, actions, settings, formats, widgets, services, anything.
  They are compiled into a build of PaperPaw, or built into a file that
  the Xteink X4 and X4 Pro load at their start, without a
  new firmware (see [Plugins as files](#plugins-as-files)).

This guide walks through a code plugin, then lists what plugins can
contribute. Working with an AI assistant: the skill in
[`.claude/skills/paperpaw-plugin-development`](../.claude/skills/paperpaw-plugin-development/SKILL.md)
tells it how to write a plugin for PaperPaw as it is (without changing
PaperPaw), try it in the emulator and on an X4, and measure it; copy the
folder into a plugin's own project (or one's own skills) to use it
there. The SDK's API documentation (`cargo doc -p paperpaw-sdk
--open`) has every detail.

## The sample plugin

[`samples/hello-plugin`](../samples/hello-plugin/src/lib.rs) is a small
plugin to start from. It adds *Hello* to the tools menu, which opens a
screen greeting you by a name set in the settings, with the number of
books opened since the start. Try it in the emulator:

```sh
cargo run -p paperpaw-emulator --features hello -- --profile boox-go-7 --set hello.name=Ada
```

*Hello* is among the tools: open *Tools* in the main menu, then
*Hello*.

### The plugin

A plugin is a type implementing [`Plugin`]: a manifest and a `register`
function. `register` runs once at start-up and adds the plugin's
contributions through a [`Registrar`]:

```rust
pub const PLUGIN: Id = Id::new_static("hello");
pub const OPEN: Id = Id::new_static("hello.open");
pub const SCREEN: Id = Id::new_static("hello.screen");

pub struct Hello;

impl Plugin for Hello {
    fn manifest(&self) -> Manifest {
        Manifest::new(PLUGIN, "Hello", Version::new(0, 1, 0))
            .description("A sample plugin to start from.")
            .uses(paperpaw_sdk::Uses::NOTHING)
    }

    fn register(&self, r: &mut Registrar) -> Result<(), RegisterError> {
        r.add_action(ActionSpec::new(OPEN, "hello.title").handler(|_, out| {
            out.push(Command::OpenScreen(SCREEN, Params::new()));
        }))?;
        r.add_menu_entry(MenuEntry::new(menus::TOOLS, OPEN).order(90))?;
        r.add_icon(OPEN, Cow::Borrowed("star"))?;
        // … the screen, a setting, an event, translations
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

Every id starts with the plugin's id (`hello.open`); `core` is the
kernel's. Titles are translation keys, translated where they are shown.

Icons are named as in [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons), any of
them (`paperpaw_sdk::icons` knows every name). PaperPaw's icon font holds
the ones it uses itself; for another, bring its drawing as an icon pack
(see below), else none shows.

### Reading and changing: `Env` and commands

Plugins never change the kernel's state directly. They read it through
[`Env`]: the device, the settings, the translations, the fonts, the
storage, the time, the battery, the passwords and keys. They change it
with [`Command`]s: open a screen or slot, go back, change a setting,
emit an event, run an action, show a short message, make an HTTP
request, keep a password, and so on. The kernel runs the commands after
the plugin's code returns.

This keeps plugins simple to test and the API message-based. It does
not confine them: a plugin runs as native code without a sandbox (see
[Plugins as files](#plugins-as-files)).

### Screens

A screen implements [`Screen`]. `draw` paints it; `on_action` reacts to
actions (from buttons, or gestures bound to them); `on_gesture` to taps,
long presses and swipes; `on_event` to events while it is open:

```rust
impl Screen for HelloScreen {
    fn draw(&mut self, canvas: &mut Canvas<'_>, env: &Env<'_>) {
        let title = env.i18n.tr("hello.title");
        self.header.draw(canvas, env, &self.style, title, None, None);
        // … the greeting, centred below
    }

    fn on_action(&mut self, action: &Id, cx: &mut Cx<'_, '_>) -> Handled {
        if *action == actions::CONFIRM || *action == actions::BACK {
            cx.command(Command::Back);
            return Handled::Yes;
        }
        Handled::No
    }

    fn on_gesture(&mut self, gesture: Gesture, cx: &mut Cx<'_, '_>) -> Handled {
        // A tap on the header's back arrow, or anywhere else, closes it.
    }
}
```

Screens are made by a factory each time they open
(`r.add_screen(ScreenSpec::new(id, title, factory))`). Return
`Handled::No` for what a screen does not handle: the kernel then runs
the action's own handler (e.g. the menu button opens the menu).

A screen that needs time to pass asks for it with `cx.wake_at(when)`,
and `on_timer` comes then. Long work goes in steps, each asking for the
next wake. `on_close_request` may keep a screen open, for example to
ask first. `on_pointer` takes a finger whole, for drawing or moving
rows.

Some rules every screen should follow:

- **Touch and buttons alike.** Some devices have only buttons (the
  Xteink X4), some mostly touch (the Boox). Everything must be easy with
  either: buttons move a focus and confirm, taps act at once. Show the
  focus only once buttons are used (`ListView::focus_on_keys`).
- **`draw` only draws.** On small devices a frame is drawn in bands
  (the X4 draws five), so `draw` runs several times for one frame, and
  again for every frame after it: whatever it reads or works out, it
  does over and over. Load what a screen shows when it opens or when
  that changes (in its factory, `on_show`, `on_event`); parse it, sort
  it, wrap long texts and make pictures small (`ui::Thumbnail`) then,
  keep the result in the screen, and only draw it in `draw`, which must
  not change state. It can skip what lies outside `canvas.clip()`. The
  one thing read while drawing is a picture too large to keep, such as
  one filling the screen: `ui::draw_image` reads its rows band by band.
  The emulator's `--trace` shows what each band of a frame reads;
  `crates/paperpaw-app/tests/draw.rs` checks every screen of the
  standard app.
- **Ask for redraws.** After a change, `cx.request_redraw()` (or a part
  of the screen) and `cx.request_refresh(mode)`: `Fast` for a moving
  focus, `Partial` for new content, `Full` to clear ghosting.
- **Overlays** are screens with a `region`. One that takes the reader's
  attention (a menu, a question) washes out what lies below it
  (`dims_below`); one looked through (a keyboard over the field it
  types into, a notice) does not. A screen whose content is best in
  grays (a picture) says so (`grays`): panels with few grays then show
  it in more, as slowly as a full refresh. A screen drawn whole with
  pictures on it (covers, `ui::draw_image`, `ui::Thumbnail`) is shown so
  anyway where *Pictures in grays* is on; one that decides itself, or
  whose pictures change often, says no (`pictures_in_grays`).
- **Use the SDK's UI parts** (`paperpaw_sdk::ui`): headers, rows, lists,
  switches, numbers with − and +, messages, icons. They follow the user's
  appearance settings and line up with the rest of PaperPaw. What a
  screen draws itself takes its look from `UiStyle`: the focus with
  `ui::draw_focus`, what is on a focused row in `style.focus_ink(focused)`
  (white on the dark bar, black on a frame or a light bar), small shapes
  with `style.radius(height)` (pills where corners are round), boxes and
  cards with `style.corner`, lines between rows with `ui::draw_separator`.

Screens say what they show, for reading the interface aloud,
automation and tests: the `ui` helpers (list rows, buttons, switches,
headers, labels) tell what they draw by themselves. A screen that draws
in its own way tells it with `canvas.describe(role, text, area,
focused, on)`, with the role of what it is (`Row`, `Button`, `Switch`,
`Check`, `Radio`, `Field`, `Image`, `Link`, `Dialog`, `Progress` …). A
screen reader of one's own hears where the focus of the buttons goes
(`events::FOCUS_CHANGED`: its role, label and area).

### Which building block for what

A plugin's screens are drawn with the SDK's `ui` module, so they look
like PaperPaw's own, follow the reader's text size and the look chosen
(a theme paints switches, the focus, buttons, headers, frames and more),
and work by touch and with the buttons alone. Sizes come from
`UiStyle::new(env)`: `margin`, `gap`, `row`, `header`, the text sizes
(`style.size(TextRole::Body)` and the others). No block shortens a
title or a button's word: a title is measured first and keeps its whole
width, a box or control beside it takes what is left, and where that is
too little the row takes a second line (ask the block for its row's
height); only a value, the reader's own text in a field, may be
shortened. `paperpaw-dev ui-kit` draws every block below on every
device, in every look, light and dark, and checks that no label is
shortened.

| For | Use |
|---|---|
| The bar at the top, a title and a note (a page count) | `ui::draw_header`, `ui::Header` (with its arrows) |
| Parts one below the other, from the top and the bottom | `ui::Stack` (`take`, `take_bottom`, `rest`) |
| Equal columns side by side, e.g. two buttons | `ui::columns(area, count, gap)` |
| A list that pages and holds the focus | `ui::ListView`, `ui::list_step` |
| Rows of a list or of settings | `ui::draw_value_row`, `ui::draw_noted_row`, `ui::draw_switch_row`, `ui::draw_setting_row`, `ui::draw_stepper`, `ui::Slider` |
| Sections with headings | `ui::Sections`, `ui::draw_heading` |
| A grid of cells (covers, tiles) | `ui::Grid` (`cell`, `hit`, `step`) |
| A group on a card or in a frame | `ui::draw_card(canvas, &style, area, Frame::Card)` returns where its parts go |
| A button, on, focused, faint, with an icon | `ui::draw_button`, `ui::draw_faint_button`, `ui::draw_icon_button` |
| A few options to pick at a glance, or tabs | `ui::Segments` |
| Filters or tags in a row, each as wide as its word | `ui::Chips` (the height of their rows: `Chips::height_for`) |
| A one-line text in a row, typed on the keyboard | `ui::draw_text_field` (its row: `text_field_height`), `ui::edit_text` |
| A list where several may be ticked | `ui::draw_check_row` (its row: `check_row_height`; the box alone: `ui::draw_check`) |
| Text longer than its room, scrolled by buttons and touch | `ui::TextView` |
| A date or a time | `ui::DatePicker`, `ui::TimePicker` |
| A box over the screen with a title, text and buttons | `ui::Dialog` |
| Asking for text, a folder, one of several options or yes or no | `ask::text`, `ask::folder`, `ask::choice`, `ask::confirm` (screens of their own) |
| A message where content would be, an empty list | `ui::draw_message`, `ui::draw_empty` |
| Progress | `ui::draw_progress` |
| An address to open on a phone, with its QR code | `ui::draw_address`, `ui::draw_qr` |
| Offering to go online where something needs the network | `ui::OfflineOffer` |
| What the buttons do, at the bottom | the screen's `hint` (the kernel draws the row) |
| First-time hints over a screen | `help::add` (see [Hints for a screen](#hints-for-a-screen)) |
| A widget's frame | `widgets::draw_frame` |

Two buttons side by side, a margin from the screen's sides and bottom:

```rust
use paperpaw_sdk::ui::{self, Stack, UiStyle};

let style = UiStyle::new(env);
let margin = style.margin as u16;
let screen = Rect::new(margin, 0, display.width - 2 * margin, display.height - margin);
let row = Stack::new(screen, margin).take_bottom(ui::Segments::height(&style));
let [ok, cancel] = ui::columns(row, 2, margin)[..] else { return };
ui::draw_button(canvas, env, &style, ok, "OK", false, focus == 0);
ui::draw_button(canvas, env, &style, cancel, "Cancel", false, focus == 1);
```

Tabs over a page, the chosen one on, moved with left and right:

```rust
let tabs = ui::Segments::new(&style, Rect::new(margin, top, width, ui::Segments::height(&style)), 3);
tabs.draw(canvas, env, &style, &["Books", "Shelves", "Notes"], self.tab, self.focus_on_tabs.then_some(self.tab));
// on_action: if let Some(tab) = tabs.step(self.tab, action) { self.tab = tab; }
// on_gesture: if let Some(tab) = tabs.hit(gesture.start) { self.tab = tab; }
```

A dialog in the middle of the screen:

```rust
let mut dialog = ui::Dialog::new(env, &style, "Delete the book?", &["It goes for good."], &["Delete", "Keep"]);
dialog.place((display.height - dialog.height()) / 2);
dialog.draw(canvas, env, &style, Some(self.focus));
```

### Settings

A setting is a constant with its id and the type of its value
(`Setting<bool>`, `Setting<i64>` or `Setting<Text>` for choices,
languages, lists and text):

```rust
pub const NAME: Setting<Text> = Setting::new("hello.name");

r.add_setting(
    SettingSpec::text(&NAME, "hello.setting.name", "")
        .group(groups::OTHER)
        .description("hello.setting.name.help"),
)?;

let name: &str = env.settings.read(&NAME);
out.push(Command::set(&NAME, "Ada".into()));
```

`SettingSpec::switch`, `number`, `choice`, `language`, `list` and
`text` make the others, their defaults of the setting's type. The
settings screens list every setting by its group, with its description
below it; the kernel saves changes to `paperpaw.ini`. Settings can be
numbers with units and steps, switches, choices, languages or text;
`advanced()` hides rarely needed ones, `scoped()` lets one be set per
book, `editor(screen)` opens a screen of your own instead. Settings
known only at run time (one per widget, say) are read by their ids,
`env.settings.text("…")` and so on. Passwords and keys do not belong in
settings: see [Passwords and keys](#passwords-and-keys).

Each setting built this way takes about 200 bytes while the device
runs. A plugin with many settings keeps them in the program instead, in
a `static` list (on the X4 it stays in flash, next to no memory):

```rust
const GROUP: Id = Id::new_static("hello.clock");
static SETTINGS: [SettingSpec; 2] = [
    SettingSpec::fixed_switch("hello.clock.date", "hello.setting.date", true, GROUP),
    SettingSpec::fixed_choice("hello.clock.face", "hello.setting.face",
        &["hello.face.plain", "hello.face.ticks"], "hello.face.ticks", GROUP)
        .described("hello.setting.face.help"),
];

r.add_settings(&SETTINGS)?;
```

Such settings are read like any other. What few settings need goes
into a `static SettingExtra`, which a setting takes with
`with_extra(&EXTRA)`: a unit, a step, a section, a slider or an editor
screen. `for_advanced()` shows a fixed setting only with the advanced
settings.

```rust
static WHILE_SYNCING: SettingExtra = SettingExtra::new().shown_if("hello.sync", "on");
static SERVER: [SettingSpec; 1] = [
    SettingSpec::fixed_text("hello.server", "hello.setting.server", "", GROUP).with_extra(&WHILE_SYNCING),
];
```

`shown_if` shows a setting only while another has a value. Here the
server's address shows while syncing is on. `check(fn)` checks a value
before it is set. A value it refuses is not set, and the reader sees
the translation of the key it returns. Screens of your
own that list settings open them as the settings pages do with
`ui::setting_opens` (its editor, the keyboard for text, the list of a
choice's values); text typed there comes back to the kernel as
`events::SETTING_TYPED`, which sets it. They lay their rows out as the
settings pages do, so that no title is cut for its control:
`ui::row_lines` tells once, when the list is made, whether a row's
control goes beside its title or below it and how high the row is
(`ui::setting_height` the height alone), and `ui::draw_number_lines`,
`ui::draw_stepper_lines`, `ui::draw_switch_lines` and
`ui::draw_setting_row` draw it there (`RowLines::at` moves it to the
row's place).

### Events

```rust
r.on(events::BOOK_OPENED, move |env, reading, out| {
    opened.set(opened.get() + 1);
    // reading.path, reading.title, reading.progress, reading.at() …
})?;
```

The kernel and plugins emit events; any plugin can listen. An `Event<P>`
names an event and what it carries, a struct made with `event_data!`,
so emitting (`EVENT.emit(data)`) and hearing (`r.on`) are checked as
the plugin is built; screens get every event too and read one with
`EVENT.read(event, params)` in `Screen::on_event`. Standard ones are in
`builtin::events`: started, a setting changed, a book opened, a page
turned, a book moved, books came into the library or left it, its
bookmarks or highlights changed, a word looked up, a place in the open
book to show, text chosen, notes exported, the device suspends or
resumes, PaperPaw stops (a restart: save as at suspending, but it is no
sleep). Plugins define their own the same way (in their namespace),
and `EVENT.schedule(data, at)` emits one at a time (work at a time,
below). Underneath, what events carry travels as named
strings (`Params`): events known only at run time are heard by id with
`r.subscribe`.

Answers come as events too, typed in `replies`: a plugin names the
event it wants, e.g. `const FETCHED: Event<HttpReply> =
Event::new("news.fetched")`, and passes it with the request.

To ask the reader, `ask::text("Server", &ENTERED).initial(url).command()`
opens the keyboard and brings back a `Typed`. `ask::folder` brings back
a `Chosen`, `ask::choice` a `Picked` and `ask::confirm` a `Confirmed`.
A value passed with `.with(key, value)` comes back in the answer's
`context`, so a plugin tells its questions apart. On `ask::choice`,
`.about(text)` comes back as the answer's `path`.

What is known of books is a service, not a screen's: `library` has a
book's details (title, author, series, tags, cover, progress, and
fields plugins add with `library::set_field`), the books read last and
the favourites, so any plugin can show or use them. Views of many books
read the catalog rather than each book (below, "What every library
offers"), show covers made small and kept on the storage
(`library::cover_variant`, a few kilobytes each, not the picture, one
for each size a view shows) and take a book's details with the size a
listing told (`library::listing`, `library::book_sized`): on a card,
each file looked up again is a search through its folder.

The bookmarks and highlights of books are shared: `annotations` reads
and keeps them, and whoever changes them emits
`annotations::changed(book)`, so the reader shows them anew and syncs
pass them on (the `koreader` plugin, for example).

State a plugin keeps between events lives in an `Rc` it hands to its
handlers when it registers.

### Translations

```ini
[meta]
language = en
name = English
plural = one-other

[messages]
hello.title = Hello
# {name} is the name set, {count} the books opened since the start.
hello.greeting.one = Hello, {name}! You opened {count} book.
hello.greeting.other = Hello, {name}! You opened {count} books.
```

Every text a plugin shows comes from catalogs like this, added with
`r.add_translations(…)`; English first, then any other language. `tr`
translates, `format` fills `{placeholders}`, `plural` picks the form for
a number. A test that all languages have the same keys belongs in every
plugin (see the sample).

Two messages say what a plugin is in the lists: `<id>.plugin.name` and
`<id>.plugin.description` (a line). *How it works* says more: a few
sentences on what it does, where it is found and how it is used, plain
text with paragraphs apart by an empty line, one file per language
beside the catalogs (`how/en.txt`, `how/de.txt`). The manifest names
them; as a table in the program they take no memory until the plugin
manager shows one (a plugin held), paged like a book:

```rust
static HOW: [(&str, &str); 2] = [
    ("en", include_str!("../how/en.txt")),
    ("de", include_str!("../how/de.txt")),
];
// In `manifest`: Manifest::new(…).description(…).how(&HOW)
```

The store shows the same text on the plugin's page and in the readers'
store: put the files into the folder you upload as well (`how/en.txt`,
`how/de.txt`), as PaperPaw's own plugins in the store have them, or say
it in the entry's `description` (see [Publishing](#publishing)). A data plugin
gives it as `<id>.plugin.how` in its catalogs, quoted, paragraphs apart
by `\n\n`. `paperpaw-dev` warns where a plugin with code has none or a
short one.

### Testing

Plugins are tested with the real kernel and an in-memory storage, as the
sample's [test](../samples/hello-plugin/tests/hello.rs) does. The kernel
comes from the crate `paperpaw-core`, a dev-dependency. Build a kernel
with the plugin and send it input. Then look at the open screen, the
settings, the files and the HTTP requests it makes (`Kernel::take_io`).
Answer them with `Kernel::http_response`. The emulator then shows how it
looks and how much memory it needs on each device:

```sh
cargo run -p paperpaw-emulator --features hello -- --profile xteink-x4 --headless --script "run:hello.open" --screenshot out.png --heap-report
```

Before a plugin is published, `paperpaw-dev` checks all of it on every
device: see [Checking your plugin](#checking-your-plugin).

## Checking your plugin

`paperpaw-dev` ([`tools/dev`](../tools/dev/src/lib.rs)) looks at a
plugin the way its users will meet it, before it is published. It runs
PaperPaw's standard app with the plugin added on emulated devices (by default
the X4, X4 Pro and Boox profiles), draws everything the plugin adds and
checks it. It finds what
is easy to miss on one's own device: a label that fits in English but not
in German, a widget that spills out of its cell at 1x1, a screen that
cannot be left with the X4's buttons, a frame that reads the card in
every band.

What it is given:

- **A plugin with code**, in its own repository: a few lines add it to
  the app (see [below](#in-a-plugins-own-repository)), then
  `cargo run --example paperpaw-dev -- check --plugin my-plugin`.
- **A data plugin**: its folder, `paperpaw-dev check path/to/my-theme`.
- **A code plugin built for a device**: `paperpaw-dev package hello.ppn`.
- **PaperPaw's own plugins**, which the app has already:
  `cargo run -p paperpaw-dev -- check --plugin widgets`.

`check` runs every command below and writes one report into
`target/paperpaw-dev` (`--out` for another folder): `report.html` with
every finding, its picture and the place marked, `report.json` for tools,
and the pages the commands made. Errors make the run fail, for CI;
warnings too with `--strict`.

```sh
cargo run -p paperpaw-dev -- check --plugin widgets --quick
cargo run -p paperpaw-dev -- visual --plugin stats --profile boox-go-7 --language de
cargo run -p paperpaw-dev -- gallery samples/plugins/airy-theme
cargo run -p paperpaw-dev -- --help
```

### Variants

A plugin is looked at in every combination of device profile
(`--profile <id>|all`; `paperpaw-dev --list` lists them), language
(`--language <code>`, by default every language the app has; `pseudo`
for the pseudo-language), light and dark (`--light`, `--dark`) and look
(`--theme <name>|all`: the default, square corners, round corners with
strong contrast). `--quick` takes one variant a device: English, light,
the default look. `--set <id>=<value>` sets a setting for every run.

### The commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `gallery` | Contact sheets: every screen the plugin adds and every widget in every size it can take, in every variant, as HTML pages (`gallery/index.html`) and one PNG sheet a plugin and device. |
| `visual` | What is drawn, checked: text cut at its box or the screen (`visual.text-cut`), shortened (`visual.ellipsis`) or broken where it should not be (`visual.wrap`); ink outside a widget's cell (`visual.outside-cell`) or the screen (`visual.off-screen`); parts over each other (`visual.overlap`); margins off the interface's (`visual.margin`) and rows out of line (`visual.align`); labels and icons off centre by their ink (`visual.ink-centre`); touch targets under 7 mm (`visual.touch-target`); buttons without the room around them (`visual.button-room`); a focus that does not show with buttons (`visual.focus`); text that dithers away on black and white or is too light on grays (`visual.contrast`). |
| `lint` | Texts and ids: translations missing or left over, placeholders and plural forms; keys shown as they are because English has no text for them (`lint.missing-key`); settings without help (`lint.setting-help`); setting groups without an order or an icon (`settings.group-order`, `settings.group-icon`), and a widget's settings in a group of the main page rather than the widget's own (`settings.widget-group`); plugins with code that say nothing or little of how they work (`lint.how-it-works`); ids outside the plugin's namespace; dashes (`lint.dash`); and in the pseudo-language, text that fits in English but not once it is longer (`lint.pseudo-overflow`) and text drawn without going through the catalogs (`lint.hardcoded`). |
| `reach` | With buttons alone: every screen the plugin adds can be reached from the home screen (`reach.unreachable`) and closed with *Back* (`reach.no-close`), the focus visits every row and button (`reach.focus-skips`) and does not get stuck (`reach.focus-trap`); a screen whose focus moves but which tells nothing of its rows (`reach.undescribed`). |
| `explore` | A cheap baseline beside the flows: every target of every screen the plugin adds (at most 20 a screen, 200 a device) used once, each from a fresh start, by touch or with the buttons; then the home screen must be reached again. A panic, an allocation the device would refuse or no way back home is an error (`explore.failed`). |
| `perf` | Budgets on the X4: storage read while drawing (`perf.draw-io`, the rule of `crates/paperpaw-app/tests/draw.rs`), the heap a screen takes against what the X4 has free (`perf.heap`), heap kept after it closes (`perf.leak`), frames estimated slow on an X4 (`perf.frame-time`), many reads before the first frame (`perf.open-io`); the top costs in `perf/index.html`. |
| `flows` | Scripted flows with assertions (`--flow a.flow`): each step's heap and frame time against the X4's budgets, and each flow played again at the edges; see below. |
| `package` | A data plugin as the device's installer and the plugin library take it (id, paths, file count and sizes, file kinds, `formats`, settings and presets that exist), installed on each device as the store does; a `.ppn` file checked as the device checks it (header, digest, the author's signature), with its fingerprint and sizes; flows and test pictures left in a data plugin's folder, which would ship with it (`package.tests`). `--release <version>` (for a `.ppn`, the release's fingerprint) tells whether that release takes it. |
| `snapshots` | Screens and widgets compared with reference pictures (`--snapshots <dir>`, `tests/snapshots` by default); `--bless` writes them anew. |
| `ui-kit` | Every building block of the SDK's `ui` module (see [Which building block for what](#which-building-block-for-what)), drawn as the gallery draws screens: on every device, in every look, light and dark, with and without the focus. Not part of `check`. |

The pseudo-language makes every English text about a third longer and
accents its letters (`[Šéţţîñĝš ~~]`); with `--language pseudo` the
gallery and the visual checks show where a translation will not fit.

### Flows

A flow is a text file of steps and of what should be true after them, run
on every device it fits:

```text
# Night mode from the menu, with buttons alone.
profiles: xteink-x4, xteink-x4-pro

long:confirm
expect screen menu.list
expect focus "Home"
right
right
right
right
expect off "Night mode"
confirm
expect setting core.night-mode = on
back
expect stack 1
expect no warnings
```

Steps are those of the emulator's scripts: a button's name, `long:`,
`tap:x:y`, `tap-on:<text>`, `long-tap:x:y`, `swipe:`, `down:`, `move:`,
`up:`, `wait:<ms>`, `run:<action>`, `open:<screen>`, `type:<text>`
into the keyboard shown, `type-enter:` to confirm it, `redraw` and
`shot:<file>`. Lines before the first step may say `profiles: a, b`
and `set: <id> = <value>`, a setting before the app starts. Assertions
are `expect screen`, `stack`, `text`, `no text`, `focus`, `on`, `off`,
`setting`, `no warnings` and `picture <name>`, which compares the
screen with a snapshot. `paperpaw-emu --record
my.flow` writes what one does in the emulator's window as a flow, to be
replayed with `paperpaw-dev flows --flow my.flow`; the `expect` lines are
added after.

Write a flow for every action of a plugin: each thing a user does with it
(a setting switched, an entry made, a sync started, a book opened from its
screen), from where they start to what should be true after, by touch and
with the buttons alone. Flows are the main test of what a plugin does;
`explore` only finds what breaks when each thing is touched once.

On the profiles with the X4's budgets every step is measured: the most
the heap held during it and its slowest frame, estimated on an X4. The
costliest step is named: `flows.heap` is an error where the X4 would run
out and a warning above an eighth of its heap, `flows.frame-time` a
warning above half a second.

Unless `--quick`, each flow is then played again in variations that find
what happens at the edges: every step done ten times; *Back*, *Home* or
sleep and waking at a few places in the middle; network answers that
fail, come late, are empty or far too large; the pseudo-language; a book
with a very long name; a storage that is almost full. Assertions are left
out there. Each variation must not panic, must stay within the heap and
must find its way back to the home screen (`flows.varied`).

Keep flows and their snapshots beside the plugin rather than in its
folder (in a plugin's own repository, `tests/flows` and
`tests/snapshots`): `package` warns of those that would ship in a
package. None of this is part of a device's build; `paperpaw-dev` runs on
the computer only.

### In a plugin's own repository

[`tools/dev/templates`](../tools/dev/templates/README.md) has what a
plugin's repository needs: the harness, the snapshot test and a CI job.
`paperpaw-dev` is a dev-dependency by git, with the tag of the release the
plugin is made for, and the SDK is patched to the same tag, so that the
plugin and the app share one:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
paperpaw-dev = { git = "https://github.com/hthoene/paperpaw", tag = "v0.4.0" }

[patch.crates-io]
paperpaw-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/hthoene/paperpaw", tag = "v0.4.0" }
```

`examples/paperpaw-dev.rs` adds the plugin to the app:

```rust
fn main() -> std::process::ExitCode {
    paperpaw_dev::main(|app| app.plugin(my_plugin::MyPlugin))
}
```

`tests/snapshots.rs` compares the cases of `tests/snapshots/cases.ini`
with the pictures beside it; `PAPERPAW_BLESS=1 cargo test --test
snapshots` writes them anew (look at each before committing it):

```ini
[x4-screen]
screen = my-plugin.screen
profile = xteink-x4

[boox-widget-wide]
widget = my-plugin.widget 4x2
profile = boox-go-7
core.night-mode = true
```

The CI job (`.github/workflows/paperpaw-dev.yml`) runs the tests,
`check --plugin my-plugin --quick` and the flows of `tests/flows`
(`flows --flow tests/flows`, varied at the edges), and keeps the report
as the run's artifact, also when a check failed.

## What plugins contribute

| Contribution | Registrar | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Actions | `add_action` | Something to do, bound to buttons and gestures, listed in menus |
| Screens | `add_screen` | Full screens and overlays (menus, dialogs, panels) |
| Slots | `add_slot`, `bind_slot` | Roles a screen fills: home, reader, library, menu, settings, keyboard, dictionary, … |
| Menu entries and sections | `add_menu_entry`, `add_menu_section`, `place_menu_entry`, `hide_menu_entry` | Actions, settings and submenus in any menu, by order or beside other entries (`MenuPlace`: after, before, in a section, first, last); another plugin's entry taken out. A menu the user redefined shows entries added later too |
| What entries show now | `set_item_state`, `describe_item` | A label, a switch, faint, hidden or a badge of the plugin's own entries as things are now (`ItemState`); a line under an entry |
| Icons | `add_icon` | The icon of an action, setting group or menu; of a semantic icon (`icons::BACK`, `NEXT`, `SHIFT`, …) for a theme; `U+F8000` names a code point of one's own |
| Settings and groups | `add_setting`, `add_setting_group` | Shown and saved by the kernel. A group names its order in the sections of the main page (`SettingGroupSpec::order`: books 1 to 49, the device 51 to 199, customising from 201) and an icon (`add_icon` with its id); one that names no order is listed at the end of customising, by name, with a plugin's icon |
| Setting defaults | `set_setting_default` | New defaults for other plugins' settings (themes) |
| Event handlers | `on`, `subscribe` | React to events |
| Key maps | `add_keymap`, `add_keymap_preset`, `add_keymap_when` | What buttons, taps and swipes do; bindings that apply while a switch is on |
| Formats | `add_format` | Open a kind of file as a document to read; big pictures may be decoded when their page shows (`Document::prepare_image`); files without a known extension told by their first bytes (`FormatSpec::sniff`); the format's own settings in `OpenOptions::setting`; a document still coming says `DocumentError::NotReady`, then `events::DOCUMENT_READY` |
| Lookup providers | `add_lookup_provider` | Where words are looked up (a glossary, a translator, Wikipedia): the dictionary's panel lists every provider's entries, those that go online when asked; an entry may open a screen with more of it (`LookupEntry::more`) |
| Reading apps | `add_reader` | A screen of the plugin that reads books of some formats (a comics reader), offered where books open and chosen per format, folder or book |
| Voices | `add_voice` | Speak text aloud in place of the system's voice, for the languages it speaks, chosen with `settings::VOICE` |
| Fonts | `add_font`, `add_font_file`, `bind_font` | Fonts and the roles they fill |
| Hyphenation | `add_hyphenation` | Patterns for a language |
| Text filters | `add_text_filter` | Change a book's text before it is laid out |
| Decorators | `add_decorator` | Mark words on book pages (a background, a line, a frame), drawn the same by every reader |
| Page layers and frames | `add_page_layer`, `add_page_frame` | Draw on book pages beside the words, with room of one's own; set pages in columns |
| Input filters | `add_input_filter` | See every button and finger first: pass it, take it, or run an action instead |
| Refresh filters | `add_refresh_filter` | Change how the panel is refreshed, e.g. in full on a screen of your own |
| Status items, lines and places | `add_status_item`, `add_status_line`, `add_status_place` | What status lines show, what a tap on an item does, how much it matters where a line is full; places where items show (`status::Place`) |
| A look | `set_ui_look` | Another look for switches, the focus, separators, buttons, headers, button hints, progress bars, sliders and widgets' frames on every screen (`ui::look`) |
| Widgets and their places | `add_widget`, `add_widget_place`, `add_widget_category` | Blocks for the home screen and the sleep screen; places that show widgets (`widgets::WidgetPlace`), in a grid or above each other (`widgets::Stack`), which plugins ask whether they show theirs (`Widgets::shown`); kinds of widgets of one's own, with their icon |
| Setup steps | `add_setup_step` | A page of the first-run setup: a setting to choose or a screen of the plugin's, where the device needs it |
| Services | `publish` | Anything one plugin offers others, found with `env.services.get` |
| Contributions | `contribute` | Additions to a point another plugin defined |
| Translations | `add_translations` | Catalogs for any language |
| Book data | `add_book_data`, `add_book_cache` | Where the plugin keeps something for each book (named by `library::key`): moved and removed with the book. What `add_book_cache` names (made again from the book when needed) is cleaned up by itself when the book is gone; what `add_book_data` names (the reader's own: notes, places) only when the reader agrees, in *Clean up storage* |
| Book fields | `add_book_field` | A value kept with books (`library::set_field`), shown on their information page and, where `in_catalog`, kept in the catalog to filter by |
| Book badges | `add_book_badge` | A few letters or an icon on books' rows in views of the library |
| Actions of others | `override_action` | Runs in place of any action's own handler; of several, the highest priority wins |
| Inputs and gestures of one's own | `add_input`, `add_gesture` | `input.<id>` and `gesture.<id>`, bound in key maps like any other |
| Bars across screens | `add_chrome` | Tabs, a dock or a bar along an edge that stays while screens open and close (`chrome`) |
| Watching | `observe_actions`, `observe_events` | Sees every action before it runs, and every event after its handlers |
| Menus by device | `set_menu_need` | Offers an entry only where the device can do it, e.g. speak |
| Points and events declared | `add_point`, `declare_event` | Says what a point takes and what an event carries, for authors and for rules |

Slots are how a plugin replaces another: bind your screen to
`core.home` and it is the home screen; the user's
`[slots]` configuration has the final word. Where several plugins offer
a screen for a slot, *Settings, Plugins, Screens* lets the reader choose
one (or *Automatic*, the plugins' order), and a plugin newly installed
that offers one asks once whether to use it now. `Env::slot_choice`,
`slot_title` and `screen_title` tell a screen of one's own the same.
Built-in slots are in
`builtin::slots`, built-in menus in `builtin::menus`: the main menu
(`core.main`), its tools (`core.tools`) and the settings' pages
(`core.settings-pages`).

```rust
// A home screen of one's own: preferred over the shipped one.
r.add_screen(ScreenSpec::new(SHELF, "shelf.title", Box::new(|env, _| Box::new(Shelf::new(env)))))?;
r.bind_slot(slots::HOME, SHELF, Priority::PREFERRED)?;
```

### What a slot's screen does

A screen bound to a standard slot takes the parameters the others open
it with and answers as they expect, so that every plugin works with it:

| Slot | Opened with | The screen |
|---|---|---|
| `core.home` | nothing; at the start and by `actions::HOME` | is the bottom of the stack: opened again, the screens above it close. It leads to the menu and the library by touch and by buttons alone. |
| `core.library` | nothing; by `actions::LIBRARY` | opens a book with `readers::open` (the reading app chosen for it). For a book it offers the menu `menus::BOOK`, as `Menus::shown_items` has it: when an entry is chosen it emits `events::BOOK_CHOSEN` with the book, then runs the entry's action. |
| `core.settings` | nothing: the groups; `params::ID`: the settings of that group; `params::FOCUS`: the page of that setting, focused on it | changes settings with `Command::SetSetting`, and a setting with an editor (`SettingExtra::editor`, a screen or a slot) by opening that (`Editor::open`). |
| `core.menu` | `params::MENU`, the menu; `params::HIDE`, entries to leave out this time | shows `env.menus.items(menu)`; for an entry chosen it closes (`Command::Back`) and runs its action (`Command::RunAction`); a setting listed there it changes, or opens its editor. |
| `core.choose-folder`, `core.choose-value` | `params::ID`, the setting | writes the folder, or the value, chosen to the setting. Name the slot as the editor (`SettingExtra::editor_slot`) to have it edited there by whichever plugin fills it. |
| `core.choice` | `params::TITLE`, `PATH` (what it is about), the options, `REPLY`; asked with `ask::choice` | shows the options; for one chosen it closes and emits the reply as a `Picked` with the option and `path`; *Back* or a tap outside closes without one. |
| `core.confirm` | `params::TITLE` (the question), `TEXT`, `ui::confirm::YES_LABEL`, `NO_LABEL`, `FOCUS_YES`, `REPLY`; asked with `ask::confirm` | asks yes or no, the focus on no unless `FOCUS_YES`; for an answer it closes and emits the reply as a `Confirmed` with all of its parameters; *Back* or a tap outside closes without one. |
| `core.keyboard` | `params::TITLE`, `TEXT` (to start from), `MODE` (`text`, `number`, `password`), `REPLY`, `LIVE` | on confirming, closes and emits the event named by `reply` as a `Typed` with all of its parameters; with `live`, on each change too, with `Typed::typing` set; *Back* closes without an answer. `ask::text` asks this way. |

The documentation of `builtin::slots` says the same for every slot.

### Which one wins

- **Slots.** The screen the user chose in `[slots]` (*Screens*,
  above); else the binding
  with the highest `Priority` (`FALLBACK`, `DEFAULT`, `PREFERRED`, or
  any number); between equal priorities, the one registered later,
  that is of the plugin loaded later.
- **Key bindings.** A later source overrides an earlier one for the
  same button or gesture: the plugins' `add_keymap`, in the order the
  plugins load; then their `add_keymap_when` while its switch is on, so
  these override the plugins' plain bindings; then the device's, the
  preset the user chose, and the user's own `[keymap.*]`. A plugin's
  binding never overrides the device's, the preset's or the user's.
- **Menus.** Entries in their `order`, equal orders in the order they
  were added; a menu the user redefined in their order, with entries
  contributed since after their neighbour.

### Examples

A format: files with these extensions open as a `Document`.

```rust
r.add_format(FormatSpec::new(
    Id::new_static("notes.format"),
    "notes.format",
    vec![Cow::Borrowed("note")],
    Box::new(|storage, path, _options| Notes::open(storage, path)),
))?;
```

A status item: what a status line shows, `None` to hide it. A tap on
it runs an action of its own plugin, here one that opens the notes.
Where a line is full, items of a low priority give way first.

```rust
r.add_status_item(
    StatusItemSpec::new(
        Id::new_static("notes.count"),
        "notes.count",
        Box::new(|env, _| Some(StatusValue::Text(count(env).to_string()))),
    )
    .tap(Id::new_static("notes.open"))
    .priority(96),
)?;
```

An input filter: it sees every button and finger first.

```rust
r.add_input_filter(InputFilterSpec::new(
    Id::new_static("lock.filter"),
    "lock.filter",
    Box::new(|env, _input| if locked(env) { InputVerdict::Take } else { InputVerdict::Pass }),
))?;
```

A request and its answer: the reply event brings the `HttpReply`.

```rust
const FETCHED: Event<HttpReply> = Event::new("news.fetched");
// In an action or a screen:
out.push(Command::Http(HttpRequest::get("https://example.org/feed", &FETCHED)));
// When registering:
r.on(FETCHED, |_env, reply, out| {
    if reply.status == 200 {
        out.push(Command::Notify(headline(&reply.body)));
    }
})?;
```

A timer: the work's event comes at that time, here each hour.

```rust
const TICK: Event<()> = Event::new("weather.tick");
out.push(Command::Work(
    Work::at(&TICK, env.now.add_millis(60 * 60 * 1000)).every(Duration::from_secs(3600)),
));
r.on(TICK, |_env, _, out| out.push(Command::Http(HttpRequest::get(FORECAST, &FETCHED))))?;
```

### What every reader offers

A plugin that works with books never names the reader plugin: it uses
what `builtin` defines for every reader, so a reader of one's own (bound
to `core.reader`) replaces the shipped one in full. A reader of some
formats only registers as a reading app instead (`readers::ReaderSpec`,
`Registrar::add_reader`): books open in the app chosen for them, and
whatever opens a book opens it with `readers::open(path)` (never by
opening `slots::READER` itself). The reader chooses with
`readers::ask_once` (*Open with …* in the book menu: this time, or kept
when asked; plugins add other ways to open a book to `menus::OPEN_WITH`),
`readers::ask` (a book's or a folder's reading app, kept) and in the reading
settings (`settings::READING_APP`, and one per format that more than one
app reads). A reading app's screen is its own; one that cannot open a
book after all answers `readers::cannot_open` instead of an error of
its own, and the next app in that order opens it. One reading app is
open at a time. What moves folders calls `readers::folder_moved`, so
that their choices go along; a shell opens a book with
`Kernel::open_book`.

| What | Standard | |
|---|---|---|
| Show a place in the open book, a part marked | `events::GOTO` (`Goto`) | readers take it; tables of contents, bookmarks, search and syncs send it |
| Text chosen, and the action chosen for it | `menus::SELECTION`, `events::TEXT_CHOSEN` | add an action to the menu, hear the event |
| Notes exported as Markdown | `events::NOTES_EXPORTED` | for notes apps and syncs |
| The reader's menus | `menus::READER`, `READER_MORE`, `READER_PANEL` | add entries there |
| The type of pages | `settings::FONT_SIZE`, `FONT_WEIGHT`, `WORD_SPACING`, `LINE_SPACING`, `MARGIN`, `MARGIN_ENDS`, `JUSTIFY`, `HYPHENATE`, `INDENT`, `PARAGRAPH_SPACING`, `WIDOWS`, `ORPHANS`, `PUBLISHER_STYLES`, `FOOTNOTES` | the kernel's settings (each book may have its own), which readers read |
| The page's words | `events::PAGE_WORDS_WANTED`, `reading::PageWords` | readers answer `reading::ask_page_words` |
| Where a book was left | `positions::{load, save}`, `Reading::xpointer` with `BOOK_CLOSED` | readers keep it; syncs and lists read it without opening the book |
| The contents, search, the marks, a footnote, skimming | `slots::TOC`, `SEARCH`, `ANNOTATIONS`, `FOOTNOTE`, `SKIM`, `events::FOLLOW_LINK`, `SKIM`, `SKIMMED` | bind a screen of one's own; readers open the slots, follow the links and go where skimming asks |
| A book opened as the reader opens it | `reading::open_options`, `reading::conversion` | its places fit the reader's (a search, contents, an XPointer) |
| Pages that go right to left | `Metadata::direction` (`PageProgression`), `Screen::mirrored` | readers mirror taps and swipes (an EPUB's `page-progression-direction`) |
| Status lines' settings | `groups::STATUS_LINES` | the group readers put them in |
| Reading aloud's settings | `setting_sections::ALOUD` | the section readers and shells put them in |
| Key bindings while reading | the layer `[keymap.core.reader]` | the slot's layer, whichever screen fills it |

A reader in turn sends the reading events (`BOOK_OPENED`, `PAGE_TURNED`,
`BOOK_CLOSED`, `BOOK_FINISHED`), takes `GOTO`, and offers its actions
in these menus.

### What the other slots promise

A screen bound to one of these slots replaces the shipped one; it is
opened with what the table says and keeps its promises, so the plugins
around it go on working.

| Slot | Opened with | Promises |
|---|---|---|
| `slots::HOME` | nothing | The start screen; where it lists things to open, it lists `menus::APPS` and `menus::TOOLS` |
| `slots::MENU` | `params::MENU`, `params::HIDE` (entries left out this time) | The menu's entries as `Menus::shown_items` has them, with their state and the line under them; runs an action, changes a setting in place, opens a submenu |
| `slots::PANEL` | `params::MENU` | The same as controls for quick changes (sliders, switches) |
| `slots::SETTINGS` | `params::ID` (a group), or nothing for all | The settings by group and `menus::SETTINGS`; a choice with fewer than two values is not listed |
| `slots::KEYBOARD` | `params::TITLE`, `TEXT`, `MODE` (`text`, `number`, `password`), `REPLY` | Emits the event `reply` with every parameter it was opened with and `text` set to what was typed; nothing when cancelled |
| `slots::LOOKUP` | `params::WORD`, `LANGUAGE` | The entries of every lookup provider that knows the language (`lookup`), those that go online only when asked; an entry's `more` opened on request, by touch and with the buttons |

Points of the shipped plugins, for `Registrar::contribute`:

| Point | A line each | |
|---|---|---|
| `keyboard.layouts` | `id; code; letter rows; variants`, e.g. `dutch.layout; NL; qwertyuiop asdfghjkl zxcvbnm; e=éèë` | a layout to choose, named by the translation of its id |
| `about.lines` | a paragraph (Markdown) | shown on *About PaperPaw*, below the address |

A reader of one's own builds on the shipped one's parts in
`paperpaw_sdk::reading` rather than copying them: `FilteredDocument` (a
book through the plugins' text filters; kept `DroppedRuns` read the
blocks they leave out once), `PageIndex` (the starts of its
pages, kept on the device), and with the feature `unstable` (as the
layout, until 1.0) `PageType` (the page's box and type from the standard
settings, its layout key), `ReadingFaces` (the faces with the book's own
fonts and small capitals), `word_boxes`, `draw_lines` and `draw_image`;
`reading::note_text` is the text a footnote shows. The layout keeps at
least `Style::widows` lines of a paragraph at the top of a page and
`orphans` at the bottom (`Style::lines_kept`, from the settings
`WIDOWS` and `ORPHANS`; a paragraph that goes on whole takes its
heading along), and
`layout::wrap_lines_hyphenated` breaks lines of one's own as pages do.

A text filter that needs to know where a block is, or leaves blocks out
(a web page's adverts, printed page numbers in a book), is a block
filter: `TextFilterSpec::block` gets a `FilterContext` (the book, its
language, the place) and answers `Verdict::Keep` or `Verdict::Drop`.

### What every library offers

A view of the library of one's own (bound to `core.library`) is as
fast as the shipped one, on the X4 too, as both ask the same service
and read the same catalog; plugins that add to the library add to
every view of it.

| What | Standard | |
|---|---|---|
| The library to ask | `library::service(env)`, a `trait Library` | A book's details, the catalog's state, queries, the index of all books, finished and favourite. Deleting books: `delete`, `can_delete`. A library of one's own publishes one as `library::service::SERVICE`, with at least `each`, `records` and `version`. |
| Every book, without reading each | `library::catalog` | One line a book: author, title, series, number, tags, how far read, favourite, opened, added, fields. Read in pieces with `each`, `each_at` and `read_at`. |
| Books found, a page at a time | `catalog::Query`, `query`, `found` | by how far read, words, author, series, tag, folder, added since; sorted by title, author, series or added |
| All books to sort and filter in memory | `library::index::Index` | 24 bytes a book, at most 2000 on the X4 (48 KB). Kept in a file while a book is open with `save` and `load`. Status changes are taken with `refresh`. |
| The catalog made anew | the kernel, as work in the background, never while a book is open | Walked once a view asks after a start (`library::request_catalog`, `request_catalog_anew`). Also for a new library folder and after `LIBRARY_CHANGED`. Caught up after `BOOK_ADDED`, `BOOK_MOVED` and changed fields. `BOOK_REMOVED` leaves a book out at once. Then `events::CATALOG_CHANGED` comes. |
| Something of one book changed | `events::BOOK_CHANGED` (`library::changed_book`, bits of `library::what`) | finished, a favourite, read further, details, cover, a field |
| A book came | `events::BOOK_ADDED` (`library::added(path, source)`) | transfers, syncs and downloads send it |
| A book deleted | `Library::delete`, which answers `library::Deleted` | Only books are deleted: a format known by its extension or first bytes, outside PaperPaw's own folder (`library::is_book_path`). Others are refused, and what fails says why. Asking first is the view's job, as the book's sheet does. The kernel's library removes the files and sends `events::BOOK_REMOVED` for each. The kernel then forgets the book and removes what is kept for it in the folders of `Registrar::add_book_data`. Views leave it out at once. |
| What can be done with a book | `menus::BOOK`, `events::BOOK_CHOSEN` | add an action to the menu, hear which book it was chosen for |
| Another way to open a book | `menus::OPEN_WITH`, `events::BOOK_CHOSEN` | add an action to the list of *Open with …*, beside the reading apps; it hears the book as the book menu's actions do |
| A book's information | `slots::BOOK_INFO` | lists the fields of `add_book_field` |
| Where the books are | `settings::LIBRARY_FOLDER` (`library::folder(env)`) | the kernel's setting, chosen with `screens::FOLDER_EDITOR` (the folder chooser of `slots::CHOOSE_FOLDER`) |

How far a book is read and whether it is a favourite change while the
catalog stands: the kernel notes such changes beside it (when a book is
opened, closed or finished, and through the service's setters), so a
view knows them at once without a new catalog and without reading each
book. A view keeps nothing of the catalog but its index, of the
library's version (`Library::version`: keys hold only for it,
`Library::is_current`); a page's books are read by their keys in one go
(`Library::records`), their badges asked then
(`library::service::badges`), never while drawing.


### Services and points of your own

A plugin can offer others more than the kernel knows of. A service is
any value published under an id in its namespace, usually a trait
object whose trait the plugin's crate exports; others use it when it is
there and do without it when not:

```rust
// The publishing plugin.
r.publish(WEATHER, Box::new(Forecast::new()) as Box<dyn Weather>)?;

// Any other plugin, wherever it has an `Env`.
if let Some(weather) = env.services.get::<Box<dyn Weather>>(WEATHER.as_str()) {
    let today = weather.today();
}
```

A service is found by its type's name too, so native code plugins built
apart from the firmware find it (see *Plugins as files* below), but only
where the type is made of the SDK's crates, `core` and `alloc` alone
(`native::CROSSING_CRATES`), whose types the plugin interface keeps as
they are. A type of a plugin's own crate may be another type of the
same name in another build, so a service of one implements
`services::ServiceType`, a key like `"weather.forecast/1"`, raised when
the type changes. Publish it with `r.provide(id, service, version)`, and
find it with `env.services.get_typed` or `get_versioned`; its size and
alignment are then checked.

A point is an id a plugin names, with what a contribution there is in
its documentation (for example one line per entry); others add to it
with `r.contribute(point, text)`, and the plugin reads
`env.services.contributions(point)`, each with the plugin it came from.

### Marks in the text

A plugin marks words on book pages with a decorator (ADR 0021): it gets
the words of a page with their places in the book and gives back ranges,
each with a *role*. The reader draws them; the plugin knows neither the
reader nor the panel.

```rust
use paperpaw_sdk::decorations::{self, Decorated, Decoration, DecoratorSpec, LineKind};

const LEARNING: Id = Id::new_static("vocabulary.learning");

// The role: its look is settings (Settings, Marks in the text), the
// plugin gives the default; themes and users change it.
decorations::add_role(r, &LEARNING, "vocabulary.role.learning",
    Decoration::NONE.line(LineKind::Dotted))?;
r.add_decorator(
    DecoratorSpec::new(Id::new_static("vocabulary.words"), "vocabulary.decorator",
        |env, page| {
            page.words
                .iter()
                .filter(|w| is_learnt(env, w.text))
                .filter_map(|w| Decorated::words(core::slice::from_ref(w), &LEARNING))
                .collect()
        })
    .switch(&MARK)          // a bool setting turns it on and off
    .taps()                 // taps on its marks come back
    .signature(|env| words_changed(env)),
)?;
r.on(events::DECORATION_TAPPED, |env, tapped, out| { /* tapped.text */ })?;
```

- A `Decoration` is a background, the text's ink, a line under the text
  (solid, dotted, dashed, wavy, double) with its tone and thickness, a
  frame, struck through; tones are named, and each panel shows them as
  well as it can (colours, or their lightness, dithered where there are
  few grays).
- Each aspect of a role is a setting of its own (`<role>.background`,
  `.ink`, `.line`, `.line-tone`, `.thickness`, `.frame`, `.struck`), so
  profiles, rules and themes set them like any other.
- Decorators are asked once a page is laid out, and again when their
  signature changes (their data, their settings): keep it cheap, and
  never work on a whole book.
- Where marks meet on a word, the earlier decorator (by `order`) wins an
  aspect both set; the rest combine.
- The reader's own marks are roles too: `roles::HIGHLIGHT`, `LINK`,
  `SEARCH_HIT`, `ALOUD`. A reader of one's own draws all marks with
  `decorations::draw_behind` and `draw_over`.
- What changes widths (bold, a larger size) is a text filter instead: it
  lays the page out again.

Words found by patterns need no code of one's own:
`decorations::PatternDecorator` marks what its patterns
(`paperpaw_sdk::pattern`, a small part of regular expressions: classes,
`\b`, repeats, `|`, groups, `(?i)`, with bounded work) find on the page's
text, each in its role:

```rust
let names = PatternDecorator::new()
    .rule(Pattern::new(r"\b(?:Mr|Mrs|Miss)\. [A-Z]\w+").unwrap(), NAME)
    .into_spec(Id::new_static("tale.names"), "tale.names");
r.add_decorator(names)?;
```

A plugin without code does the same with a `marks.ini`, a section per
role (`<plugin>.<section>`), its patterns and its look:

```ini
[names]
title = Names
pattern = \b(?:Mr|Mrs|Miss)\. [A-Z]\w+
background = yellow
line = wavy
```

Any plugin can read the words of the page shown, not only decorators:
`reading::ask_page_words(&MY_WORDS)` asks the reader, which answers with
the event `MY_WORDS`, a `reading::PageWords` (the book, the page's start
and end, its words with their places).

### Drawing on the page

A page layer (`layers::PageLayerSpec`) draws on every page a reader
shows: side notes, a reading ruler, change bars. It may reserve room at
a side of the text, which is then laid out without it, and it hears
taps on that room (`events::PAGE_LAYER_TAPPED`, also when the room is
chosen with the buttons, as links are):

```rust
use paperpaw_sdk::layers::{PageLayerSpec, Side};

r.add_page_layer(
    PageLayerSpec::new(Id::new_static("notes.margin"), "notes.margin", |canvas, env, page| {
        let Some(room) = page.room else { return };
        for line in page.lines.iter().filter(|l| has_note(env, page.path, l.start)) {
            canvas.fill_rect(room.x.into(), line.area.y.into(), 4, line.area.height.into(), Color::BLACK);
        }
    })
    .reserve(|env| Some((Side::Right, env.metrics.mm(8) as u16)))
    .taps(),
)?;
```

- `page` (`PageView`) has the book, the page's start and end, the
  text's box and columns, its lines (`LineBox`: where each is and what
  it holds), the status lines and the layer's room.
- Layers draw what they know from memory, on some devices once for every
  band of the page: they read nothing from storage there. Those of an
  order below 0 are drawn behind the text.
- A layer whose drawing changes while the page stays asks for the
  screen to be drawn again (`Command::Redraw`).

A frame (`layers::PageFrameSpec`) sets the text in columns: two
columns, two pages side by side. The setting `core.page-frame` (each
book may have its own) offers every frame by its id, named by the
translation of the id:

```rust
r.add_page_frame(PageFrameSpec::columns(Id::new_static("columns.two"), 2, 24))?;
```

### Pictures over what is drawn

Any screen, widget, theme or overlay draws a picture over what is drawn
already: a PNG or GIF keeps its transparency (an alpha channel, a
palette's or a colour key) when decoded with
`image::picture_with_alpha` (others come out opaque; why not, where it
cannot be read), and `ui::draw_image_over` blends it in, its clear
parts showing what is below, its edges mixed with it, and all of it as
see-through as its `opacity` (0 to 255) says. The mix is dithered as
pictures are, so it keeps its lightness on panels of two or four grays;
rows are read and blended one at a time, so a picture takes no memory
of its size. Pictures made larger than they are decoded are
interpolated, not blocky.

```rust
match image::picture_with_alpha(env.storage, "plugins/owls/owl.png", &cache, Fit::side(200)) {
    Ok(image) => ui::draw_image_over(canvas, env.storage, &image, area, 192), // a quarter see-through
    Err(why) => { /* e.g. "unsupported image: interlaced PNG" */ }
}
```

An overlay that draws only part of its region, or blends over it, says
what shows through it (`Screen::shows_through`): every screen below it,
menus too (`ShowsThrough::All`), or the topmost full screen alone, a
menu left open over it not drawn (`ShowsThrough::FullScreen`); what
shows is drawn first under all of it. A screen guarding the device is
marked in `env.stack` (`StackEntry::guards`), so that nothing shows what
is below it. The sleep screen's *The page with a picture* shows the
full screen through: a picture or a widget over the page being read;
pictures for it are offered as presets (below).

A setting's choices are open to other plugins: `Registrar::add_choice`
offers a value of one's own among them (in one's namespace, the
translation key of its name), after the setting's own. This is how the
sleep screen shows a screen of another plugin as one of its modes. The
flash card due and the reading cat are such modes:

```rust
r.add_screen(ScreenSpec::new(Id::new_static("aquarium.sleep"), "aquarium.sleep", factory))?;
r.add_choice(Id::new_static("sleep.show"), "aquarium.sleep")?;
```

### Widgets

A widget is a [`Widget`] a screen makes and keeps
(`env.widgets.make`): it reads what it shows in `update`, which the
screen calls when it shows the widget, about each minute and after
events, and only draws in `draw` (which runs for every band of a
frame). The screen tells it where it goes (`place`) before drawing it
there: what is made for that size, such as a cover made small
(`ui::Thumbnail`), is made then, and again in `update` when what it
shows changed. Register it with `WidgetSpec::new(id, title, factory)`; a widget
with nothing to read, such as a clock, is a pair of functions
(`WidgetSpec::drawn` with `Drawn::new(height, draw)`, and `shows` to be
drawn again when what it shows changes). A widget whose content changes
only after events (books, settings) says so (`live` false) and is not
read again each minute; one that can be drawn smaller says how small
(`min_height`), so that a grid fits it where its full height has no
room. `widgets::grid` puts widgets
and tools in a grid as the home screen does, edited in place
(`GridView`). Say which kind a widget is
(`.category(widgets::categories::TIME)`, or `BOOKS`, `READING`, `WORDS`,
`PERSONAL`, `WORLD`, `DEVICE`): the home screen offers widgets by their
kind, each drawn as it would show.

A widget may also react. `targets` names the places in it that do
something. `on_input` gets taps, swipes and the buttons there, and
`context` tells it its placement and the screen it is on. `draw_focus`
draws the focus its own way.

### Widgets with settings

A widget may have settings of its own, such as where its text sits. Put
them in a settings group with the widget's id
(`widgets::settings_group`); the settings list leaves such groups out,
and the home screen's editor offers them as the widget's *Settings*. For
the alignment there is a ready setting: register
`widgets::align_setting(&id, Align::Left)` and place each text with
`widgets::align(env, id).x(area, width)`.

Widgets of all plugins share a look the reader shapes for each, so that
they sit well together on a page: give yours a frame and draw in it.

```rust
const ID: Id = Id::new_static("my.card");
static SETTINGS: [SettingSpec; 4] = [
    widgets::align_spec("my.card.align", ID, Align::Left),
    widgets::frame_spec("my.card.frame", ID, Frame::None), // none, line, light or dark card
    widgets::size_spec("my.card.size", ID, Size::Medium, true), // true: also "as large as it fits"
    widgets::part_spec("my.card.author", ID, "my.show-author", true),
];
r.add_setting_group(widgets::settings_group(&ID, "my.card"))?;
r.add_settings(&SETTINGS)?;

fn draw(&self, canvas: &mut Canvas<'_>, env: &Env<'_>, area: Rect) {
    let look = widgets::draw_frame(canvas, env, ID.as_str(), area);
    let rest = widgets::draw_caption(canvas, env, ID.as_str(), &look, "Today");
    let size = widgets::size(env, ID.as_str()).text(&UiStyle::new(env));
    // ... the content in `rest`, in `look.ink` (and `look.faint` for
    // what matters less), never in a fixed black: on a dark card it is
    // light.
}
```

A widget may be placed more than once, each placement with its own
values of the widget's settings: the home screen places a clock as
`widgets.clock@1` and `widgets.clock@2`, whose frames are the settings
`widgets.clock@1.frame` and `widgets.clock@2.frame` (saved like any
other, the widget's own `widgets.clock.frame` where one sets none).
`env.widgets.make` gives a placement's widget, which reads its settings
by their usual ids and gets that placement's values
(`Settings::with_placement`); a widget need do nothing for it. Screens
of their own that place widgets use `Id::placement` and forget a
placement's values when it goes (`Settings::placement_values`).

`widgets::shows(env, id, "author")` reads a part's switch,
`widgets::choice` makes other choices of the widget's own, and
`widgets::draw_message` says kindly what is not there yet. A widget's
`height` counts its frame (`widgets::look::look` gives the area inside
it without drawing). For round things there are `Canvas::fill_circle`,
`stroke_circle`, `fill_ring` (arcs, e.g. a progress ring) and
`draw_hand`, with angles as on a clock face (`paperpaw_sdk::round`);
light grays are drawn with `fill_shaded` or `fill_round_shaded`, which
dither them on black and white panels.

Screens that place widgets one below the other should know the kernel's
two widgets for room between them: `widgets::SPACE` is an ordinary
widget, a gap; `widgets::FILL` has no height of its own and takes its
share of the room the others leave (`widgets::fill_height`). Both may
be in a list more than once (`widgets::repeatable`).

### Presets

A preset is a ready-made set of setting values chosen as a whole
(`paperpaw_sdk::presets`). It has a kind, named by the plugin that
offers such presets. That plugin lists those of its kind with
`env.settings.presets().of_kind(kind)`. It works out what one changes
with `Preset::changes` and the settings it covers. It shows it with
`Command::PreviewSettings`: the values show on every screen without
being kept, until the screen that asked closes. It keeps it with
`presets::commands`. The settings of its kind that a preset leaves out
go back to their defaults.

The kinds PaperPaw's own plugins offer are themes (`core.theme`,
below) and the power modes, `core.power-mode`, which the kernel offers.
The sleep screen offers pictures over the page as `sleep.overlay`, see
[Plugins without code](#plugins-without-code). Add presets kept in the
program with `Registrar::add_presets`, a `static` list of
`Preset::fixed`. They may be of your own kind or another plugin's:

```rust
static THEMES: [Preset; 1] = [Preset::fixed(
    "my.dusk",
    presets::THEME,
    "my.dusk",      // translation keys of its name
    "my.dusk.help", // and of a sentence on it
    "core.ui-focus = core.focus.ring
core.ui-separators = core.separators.none",
)];

r.add_presets(&THEMES)?;
```

A theme is a preset of the kind `core.theme` (`presets::THEME`): values
for the appearance settings. Where any plugin brings one, the
appearance settings begin with *Theme*, which lists them; the one
chosen gives the appearance settings its values and those it leaves
out their defaults, so two themes installed never fight. A data plugin
brings themes in its `presets.ini`:

```ini
[paw]
kind = core.theme
name = Paw
description = Round and friendly: a frame for the focus, no lines.
core.ui-corners = core.corners.soft
core.ui-focus = core.focus.ring
core.ui-separators = core.separators.none
```

### Hints for a screen

The first time a screen opens, a short note over it says what its
controls do: the hints its plugin gives with `help::add`, each a text
and, where it is about a part of the screen, that part (in thousandths
of the screen's width and height), framed. A hint is for touch, for
buttons or for both; a device shows those that fit its input. A tap or
any button closes the note, and it does not come again for that screen;
*No more hints* and the settings switch them all off.

```rust
use paperpaw_sdk::help::{self, Hint, Zone};

help::add(r, SCREEN.as_str(), &[
    Hint::touch("hello.help.tap").zone(Zone::new(0, 0, 1000, 120)),
    Hint::buttons("hello.help.confirm"),
    Hint::any("hello.help.back"),
])?;
```

The texts are keys of the plugin's translations; the screen is any
screen's id, so a plugin can add hints to another's. A screen that first
prepares what it shows (the reader, opening a book) has its hints wait
with `help::wait(r, SCREEN.as_str())` and says when it is ready,
`cx.command(help::ready(&SCREEN))`: screens below another get no timers,
so it would not get ready under them. The note is the
`help` plugin's; another plugin can show them its own way, from
`help::hints(env, screen)` when `events::SCREEN_SHOWN` comes.

### Passwords and keys

Plugins keep passwords, API keys and tokens with
`Command::SetSecret(SecretChange::keep(id, label, value))` and read them
with `env.secrets.get(id)`. They are all listed in *Settings, Passwords
and keys*, where the user changes or removes them. Ask for one on the
keyboard in password mode (`ask::text(…).password()`); the keyboard
offers to type it on a phone. They are kept apart from the settings and
not readable at a glance, but not encrypted: the devices have no safe
place for a key. A plugin sees its own alone: name them in its
namespace (`myplugin.token`); `env.secrets.get` gives another plugin's
none, and `env.secrets.listed()` names every secret without its value.
A setting marked `secret()` is kept the same way. Native code is not
sandboxed and could go past this; the SDK hands no plugin another's
secret.

### The network

`Command::Http(HttpRequest::get(url, &FETCHED))` makes a request where
the device has a network (`env.caps.network`); the answer comes as the
request's reply event, an `HttpReply` with the status and the body, or
saved to a file (`.save_to(path)`) for large ones. A request may set a
`timeout`, the answer's headers it wants back (`want_headers`) and the
longest body kept in memory (`max_body`, by default 64 KiB on small
devices). Every request is answered once, also when it is refused
(`HttpReply::refused` says why and when to try again). The manifest says
that the plugin uses the network (`.uses(Uses::NETWORK)` in its manifest); without it,
requests are refused. In Offline (`env.power`), only what the reader went
online for goes out: a screen that needs the network says so on itself
and offers *Go online*, which sends `Command::GoOnline` (the network for
that screen until it closes); anything else is refused with
`Reason::Offline` and may try again on `events::WORK_ALLOWED`.
`Command::CancelHttp` takes requests back. Where a server or a computer
is told which device this is (a sync service, Calibre), the name is
`env.device_name()`: the one the reader set under *Device name*, else
the model's; a plugin never makes one of its own.

### Work in the background

What a plugin does on its own, not because the reader just asked for
it, it declares as work (`paperpaw_sdk::work`, ADR 0025), and the
kernel runs it at the moment that costs least: waking, a book opened or
closed, going to sleep, the radio on anyway, charging, idle.
`Command::Work(Work::network(PUSH).within(Duration::from_secs(1800))
.at_moments(Moments::BOOK_CLOSED | Moments::SLEEP))` sends the reading
position when the book is closed or the device sleeps, at the latest
after half an hour; the kernel then emits the work's event and the
plugin makes its request. `optional()` work (weather, headlines) runs
only while that is cheap, and never brings the radio on by itself.
`Work::at(event, time)` is a timer, `every` repeats, `key` tells
several works of one event apart, `Command::CancelWork` takes one back.
`env.reader` says whether what is handled is the reader's own doing: an
action the reader ran acts at once, the same action run by a rule
declares `Work::when_cheap(id, within)` instead and waits for a good
moment.
Long work in steps (an install, a catalog walked) registers its step
function (`r.add_work(WorkSpec::new(id, title, step))`) and is stepped
between frames. `env.work` says where a work stands, for the plugin's
own page; background work never shows a notice over reading. The power
mode (`env.power`) makes deadlines longer or holds network work back;
most plugins need not read it.
Read large JSON answers as they stream with
`paperpaw_sdk::json::stream`, so they need little memory.
`Command::Serve` serves HTTP to the local network, e.g. for transfers
from a computer or typing on a phone; what happens to it comes as
`ServerNotice`s. A plugin answers each request with `Command::Respond`.
A server stops when the screen that started it closes. Serve only while the screen showing the
address is open, and guard it as `paperpaw_sdk::served` does: a key
drawn anew each time in the address (`served::key`), checked by a
`served::Guard`, which turns requests away for a while after a few
wrong keys. Where PaperPaw runs Wi-Fi itself (the X4s),
`paperpaw_sdk::wifi` says the radio's state, and
`WifiCommand::Host` opens a network of the device's own for a phone to
join, as the Wi-Fi transfer does without a router.

Other protocols go over sockets ([ADR 0014](adr/0014-sockets-for-plugins.md)):
`Command::Connect` opens a TCP connection, `Command::SocketSend` sends,
and `Command::SocketRead` asks for what comes next, as text
(`SocketRead::Text`) or as a file of a known length written to storage as
it comes (`SocketRead::File`), so files of any size never need to fit in
memory. `Command::Broadcast` finds services in the local network by a
UDP datagram and their answers. Everything comes back as events
(`SocketNotice`s, `socket_params`); a socket closes when the screen
that was open as it opened closes.

### Firmware updates

Where PaperPaw is the device's firmware (the X4s), `env.firmware` says
which version runs and how an install goes; elsewhere it is `None`.
`Command::Firmware(FirmwareCommand::Install { path, key, older })`
installs a signed update file: `key` is the key of one not signed by
PaperPaw that the reader accepted, shown its fingerprint, `older` that
they chose one not newer than the running firmware
(`firmware::Update::may_install` is the shell's check).
`FirmwareCommand::Restart` restarts into it once
`FirmwareState::Installed`; `events::FIRMWARE_CHANGED` comes on the
way. `firmware::Update::read` tells what a file holds before. The
`update` plugin does all this for update files on the card; a plugin
that fetches updates from somewhere else only needs to put the file
there.

## Memory

PaperPaw's code guidelines ([CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#code-guidelines)) hold for plugins too: length limits, errors on user data, memory, comments.

The smallest device, the Xteink X4, has 256 KiB of heap for everything.
PaperPaw's standard app holds some 168 KiB of it once it has started
with the sample books, 201 KiB at its peak (the emulator, `--profile
xteink-x4 --headless --script wait:500`). A plugin that should run
there:

- keeps little in memory: lists in files, read as they are needed;
- reads files a piece at a time (`Storage::read_at`), never whole books;
- writes downloads straight to storage (`HttpRequest::save_to`);
- reserves large buffers with `try_reserve` and copes when that fails;
- checks `env.device.memory` (`MemoryClass::Small`) to do less there.

The emulator's X4 profile enforces the budget. After a run with
`--headless`, `--heap-report` shows where memory goes.
`--trace-alloc <bytes>` prints each allocation of at least that size.

## Plugins as files

A code plugin can also be a file, `code.ppn`, in a plugin's folder on
the card, which the X4 and the X4 Pro load at their
start (ADR 0024): from the plugin store, from the web flasher with the
firmware, or sent from a computer over the USB cable or the Wi-Fi
transfer, where the device asks first ([USB transfer](usb-transfer.md)).
Only code installed runs. An installer names the file by its digest
(`native::remember_code`, kept in `.paperpaw`, which plugins' folders do
not reach), and a file put into a plugin's folder otherwise is not run;
the plugin manager says why. An author trying their own build sends it
with `tools/usb-transfer.py install <folder>`. Its code is the same as that
of a plugin built in, and it runs as part of PaperPaw, at full speed
and without a sandbox: it can do
whatever PaperPaw can, also past the SDK. The X4 Pro runs it from its
PSRAM; the X4 writes it once into the flash behind its
firmware and runs it from there, not from its RAM.

PaperPaw's own plugins that not every reader needs (statistics, widgets,
Calibre, the syncs and the others of
[`tools/plugin-files/plugins.txt`](../tools/plugin-files/plugins.txt))
come this way on the X4s: their firmware leaves them out, and each
release builds them as files, signed with PaperPaw's plugin key, which
readers install from the store.

[`samples/hello-native`](../samples/hello-native) is the sample plugin
above as a file, in a workspace of its own as a plugin's own repository
is, with a CI job to start from.

### The crate

The plugin stays a library crate, tried in the emulator and tested as
any other. A second crate, a `#![no_std]`, `#![no_main]` binary, makes
the file with one line:

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

paperpaw_sdk::plugin!(my_plugin::MyPlugin::default());
```

`plugin!` gives the file its entry, its heap (the kernel's: what the
plugin boxes, the kernel may drop) and its panic handler. The crate's
`.cargo/config.toml` links it as a plugin: copy the sample's, and the
sample's `paperpaw-plugin.x` beside it at the top of the project (the
PaperPaw release's own, from `paperpaw-native`; no build script brings
it, so a build on Windows is the same as one on Linux). It links with
it, keeps the relocations, and on the X4 builds with the medium code model and frame
pointers. It also sets `--cfg paperpaw_plugin`, with which the SDK asks
the firmware for what it has already instead of copying it into the
file (the names of all icons, some 125 KB in a plugin that draws an icon
by name). Build it for both chips:

```sh
cargo x4                  # riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf, the X4
cargo +esp x4pro          # xtensa-esp32s3-none-elf, the X4 Pro (espup's toolchain)
```

The X4's core libraries (`core`, `alloc`) come from rustup, with the
target in the sample's `rust-toolchain.toml`. The X4 Pro's come with each
PaperPaw release, built once and signed
(`paperpaw-xtensa-std-<version>.tar.gz`): install them into the `esp`
toolchain once for each release, with PaperPaw's
`tools/xtensa-std/install.sh` or by hand as its README says. Without
them, `cargo +esp x4pro` finds no `core`.

### Which build fits

A plugin file runs on every PaperPaw of the plugin interface it was
built for ([ADR 0026](adr/0026-plugin-interface-version.md)),
whichever release made it: its fingerprint holds the interface's
version (`native::INTERFACE`, in its top 16 bits), the chip and the
features that change what crosses (`outline`, colour), and a digest of
the layouts of the types that cross. A device loads only files with its
own fingerprint; *About* shows it and the compiler to build with, and
`paperpaw-sign plugin` names a file's interface.

**When to rebuild:** when a release raises the plugin interface (its
release notes say so, and so does the plugin manager on the reader:
*Built for another plugin interface*), and only then. Build with the
toolchain the release names (the sample's `rust-toolchain.toml`, and
espup's of `versions.env` for the X4 Pro): until 1.0 a new compiler is a
new interface. The file names the compiler that built it:
`paperpaw-sign pack` takes it from the plugin's `.comment`, which the
format's linker script keeps, and a device loads the file only where
that compiler built the firmware too. A beta or a release that keeps
the interface runs the plugin as it is. The store and the update check
show which plugins wait for a build.

### The file in the emulator

The desktop emulator loads a plugin's code built for the computer it runs
on, as Android loads `code.so`: a `cdylib` crate with the same
`plugin!` line, built with the emulator's toolchain against its SDK with
the `outline` feature (`paperpaw-sdk = { version = "0.4", features =
["outline"] }`), is `code-host.dll`, `code-host.so` or `code-host.dylib`
in the plugin's folder (`plugins/<id>/` of the emulator's library,
beside its `plugin.ini`). The emulator runs such code only when it is started
with `--trust-code`, which installs every such file in the library first
(as on a device, only code installed runs); without it, none, whatever
the library says is installed: a library copied from elsewhere runs no
code of its own.

```sh
paperpaw-emu --library my-library --trust-code
```

Over `--stdio`, `start` with `"trust_code": true` does the same, and
`reload` loads a new build; `ready` says the fingerprint and compiler
the emulator takes.

### Packing and signing

`paperpaw-sign` (in this repository, `tools/sign`) makes the file from
the linked plugin and signs it as its author:

```sh
paperpaw-sign key author.key                      # once; keep it safe, never publish it
paperpaw-sign pack target/riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf/release/my-plugin my-plugin-x4.ppn --key author.key
paperpaw-sign plugin my-plugin-x4.ppn             # what it holds, and who signed it
```

`pack` refuses what cannot run from where the file lands: writable data
(a `static` that changes; keep state on the heap, as in `Rc`s handed to
closures), symbols it cannot find, and code that reaches an address
fixed in the firmware or ROM directly. The signature goes into the file
itself, so it travels with it; a device remembers the author's key at
the first install (from the store, the key the plugin library names for
its author) and warns when an update is signed by another.

### Trying it on a device

A code plugin is a folder like a data plugin's, with its code beside its
`plugin.ini`:

```text
plugins/my-plugin/
  plugin.ini     [plugin] id, name, description, version
  code.ppn       its code, for this device and this firmware
  i18n/*.ini     translations, settings.ini, … as for data plugins
```

`plugin.ini`'s version is the plugin's: the store, the installer and
updates go by it, and the device shows it. The code's manifest must name
the same version (`paperpaw-dev package` with the folder and `--plugin`
says where it does not).

Send the folder from a computer and say yes on the device
(`python tools/usb-transfer.py install my-plugin`, or the Wi-Fi
transfer); it is loaded at once. A firmware built for development also
takes a folder over its remote control
(`tools/x4-remote.py --push my-plugin plugins/my-plugin --trust-code
my-plugin`, a folder under `plugins/`). The plugin manager lists it as one with code,
and says why one does not run (built for another PaperPaw, damaged, no
room, not installed, changed since it was installed). Over USB, `--script native` (and `--info`)
says where each plugin lies and what loading it took.

A panic's calls inside a plugin are kept with its name and the offset
into its file, e.g. `4261a402 (my-plugin+0x452)`: its function lies at
`0x42000000 + offset - 80` in the plugin's ELF. A plugin that crashes
before PaperPaw shows its first frame is switched off: after two such
starts PaperPaw starts without the plugin the crash was in (without all
plugins with code where that is not known) and says so; holding *Back*
on the X4, *Home* on the X4 Pro, while switching it
on starts without them too. The plugins it switched off are switched on
again in the plugin manager, one at a time.

### Keeping it small

On the X4 every plugin's file takes room in flash. A plugin carries its
own copy of the SDK code it uses, which is most of a small plugin: the
sample's file for the X4 is 78 KB (76 KB of code and constant data),
though the plugin itself is a screen, an action and a setting.

- Build with `opt-level = "s"` (as PaperPaw) or `"z"` (smaller, a little
  slower), `lto = "fat"`, `codegen-units = 1`, `panic = "abort"`, as the
  sample does.
- Leave out what pulls in large parts of `core`: parsing floats from
  text (`str::parse::<f32>()`, 16 KB of tables), `{:?}` of strings.
- Keep translations and other text in the folder's files rather than in
  the code, where they are needed once.

Services between plugins are found by their type's name too where the
type is the SDK's, so a plugin built apart finds those of the firmware's
plugins; one of a plugin's own type needs a contract (see [Services and
points of your own](#services-and-points-of-your-own)).

### Publishing a code plugin

The plugin library (paperpaw.org) lists a code plugin with its folder
and a build per reader (`x4`, `x4-pro`), each a signed
`.ppn` with the fingerprint it was built for, the author's key, and its
source, which the library rebuilds to compare. The sample's `build.sh`
builds, packs and signs both files, and its CI job
(`samples/hello-native/.github/workflows/build.yml`, for a plugin's own
repository) runs it on every tag, with the author's key kept as a
secret of the repository. [Publishing](#publishing) says how.

## Plugins without code

A data plugin is a folder:

```text
plugins/large-print/
  plugin.ini     [plugin] id, name, description, version, formats
  i18n/*.ini     translation catalogs (also whole new languages)
  keymap.ini     key bindings
  settings.ini   new defaults for any plugin's settings ([core] font-size = 14)
  fonts/*.ttf    fonts to read with (also .otf, .ttc), by family
  fonts/*.ppfp   packs with letters other fonts lack, named in plugin.ini:
                 [extends] cyrillic.ppfp = fonts-default.literata
  fonts/…        a family's faces, named in plugin.ini: [family] name,
                 regular, bold, italic, bold-italic (packs, or .ttf/.otf
                 where scalable fonts are drawn)
  styles.css     a stylesheet for books, after a book's own (EPUB)
  presets.ini    ready-made sets of settings, e.g. themes
  marks.ini      words marked on book pages by patterns (formats 2)
  menus.ini      entries of menus, a menu of one's own (formats 3)
  actions.ini    actions made of steps (formats 3)
  icons.ini      icons of actions and settings: item = icon-name (formats 3)
  points/*.txt   lines for a point, one a line, e.g. about.lines.txt (formats 3)
  setup.ini      steps of the first-run setup (formats 3)
```

[Files on the card](data-files.md#a-data-plugins-files) lists each of them
with its format, what reads it and an example, and how a `settings.ini`
brings a home screen of its own.

`plugin.ini` may also bind fonts to roles (formats 3):

```ini
[fonts]
core.font-ui-strong = my.semibold
```

An action of `actions.ini` runs its steps in order, at most 16:
`<setting>=<value>` sets a setting (a value not of its kind is passed
over, and a setting that keeps the device safe, such as the lock's, is
never set), `open:<slot>` opens a slot, `notify:<text>` says something,
`emit:<event>` emits an event of the plugin's own (`<plugin>.<name>`),
and an action's id runs that action (not one of the same file). A
section names the action. Without the plugin's id in front, it gets
it: `[night]` in the plugin `my` is `my.night`.

`menus.ini` adds to any menu, places an entry after another and takes
entries out; `title` and `entries` make a menu
of one's own, which other menus list by its id:

```ini
# actions.ini
[night]
title = Night reading
icon = moon
run = core.night-mode=on, core.font-size=14, notify:Good night

# menus.ini
[core.reader-menu]
add = my.night after core.toc

[core.reader-more]
hide = stats.open

[my.tools]
title = My tools
entries = my.night, core.library

# setup.ini
[size]
setting = core.font-size
order = 35
```

`formats` says which version of these files' formats the plugin is made
for (3 now: menus, actions, icons, points, setup steps and font roles
came with it, `marks.ini` with 2; 1 if it is left out); a PaperPaw
that reads an older one leaves the plugin out and says why, rather than
reading it wrongly. The files of formats 3 are read only for a plugin
that says `formats = 3`; for one made for an earlier version they are
left out, and PaperPaw says so.

A plugin's files take at most 96 KiB together besides its translations
(512 KiB of their own), those of formats 3 at
most 24 KiB of it, and its points at most 64 lines; what goes past is
left out and told. Each file takes at most 64 KiB, and `plugin.ini` at
most 4 KiB. `points/` holds at most 16 files. A default (`settings.ini`) or a preset does not
change a setting that keeps the device safe, such as the lock's.

Packs for other scripts are read a glyph at a time, so devices with
little memory can use them ([ADR 0018](adr/0018-font-packs-for-other-scripts.md)).
`tools/script-pack.py` builds Cyrillic and Greek for Literata.
Icon packs are such packs for the icon font: `tools/icons/pack.py` builds
one with the Tabler icons named
(`[extends] icons.ppfp = fonts-default.icons`).

A family of its own needs a name and a regular face; its faces are
packs, drawn on every device and read a glyph at a time, or font files,
drawn where scalable fonts are, a variable font at its style's weight:

```ini
[family]
name = Fredoka
regular = regular.ppfp
bold = bold.ppfp
```

A logo of its own takes the place of PaperPaw's (on the sleep screen,
the About page and the logo widget): a picture in the folder, named in
`settings.ini`:

```ini
[core]
logo = plugins/my-brand/logo.png
```

A theme can also be a `settings.ini` with new defaults. It is then not
chosen under *Theme*; it is on while the plugin is on. Its defaults are
for the appearance settings (*Settings > Customise > Appearance*, most of them with
advanced settings): the header (`core.header.plain`, `.light`, `.dark`),
the corners (`core.corners.square`, `.small`, `.round`, `.soft`; round
and soft ones make buttons and switches pills), the highlight
(`core.focus.fill`, `.ring`, `.soft`), the lines between rows
(`core.separators.inset`, `.line`, `.none`), lists on cards
(`core.groups.cards`), the size of headers' titles, the margins, rows
and lines:

```ini
[core]
ui-focus = core.focus.ring
ui-separators = core.separators.none
ui-title = 140
ui-row = 180
```

Pebble, a theme with lists on cards for touch screens, comes with
PaperPaw, switched off in the plugin manager.

The fonts browser (`plugins/fonts-browser`) downloads fonts as such
plugins from paperpaw.org: font files for devices with scalable fonts
and the memory for them, packs for the others. The store
(`plugins/store`, *More plugins*) lists the other plugins of the plugin
library made for the device, data plugins and, where PaperPaw loads
them and a build fits, plugins with code, and installs, updates and
removes them ([ADR 0023](adr/0023-plugin-store.md)). Both build on the
SDK's `install` module: an `Installer` downloads a `Package`'s files one
after another into `plugins/.<id>.part`, checks each by its size and
digest (SHA-1 or SHA-256), then has the kernel install it
(`Command::InstallPlugin`) in place of
every version of it before, what was chosen from it still chosen; the
job is kept on the storage, so it goes on with no screen open. Where a
plugin came from is kept once it is in place (`install::origin`): the
store updates only those it installed, and one put in place otherwise
(the Wi-Fi transfer, the USB cable, a card) is local, which the plugin
manager says. `install::local::Staging` installs a plugin sent file by
file, with the same checks.

Copy it into the `plugins` folder of a device (or of the emulator's
library) and restart, or have a plugin load it at once
(`Command::LoadPlugin` with its folder; `Command::RemovePlugin` removes
one, its fonts and presets at once, the rest after the next start). A plugin's `styles.css` comes after a book's own
stylesheets and before one's own (`styles.css` beside the books, then
the one named like a book), so the more particular wins; plugins with
code add theirs with `Registrar::add_stylesheet`.

A `presets.ini` holds presets (see above), a section each: its `kind`,
its `name` and `description` (translation keys from its `i18n`, or the
text itself), then the settings it sets by their whole id. Themes are
such presets (`kind = core.theme`, above). Pictures over the page for
the sleep screen are presets of `sleep.overlay`: the picture (or a
widget, `sleep.overlay-widget`), and where it goes and how large it is
if the preset likes (what it leaves out stays as the reader set it).

```ini
[owl]
kind = sleep.overlay
name = Owl
sleep.overlay-picture = plugins/owls/owl.png
sleep.overlay-position = sleep.position.bottom-right
sleep.overlay-size = 40
```

The picture's clear parts show the page, so a PNG with transparency
looks best. [`samples/plugins`](../samples/plugins) has large print,
three themes (airy, paw, calm ink) and a home screen (reading nook).

## Publishing

The plugin library on paperpaw.org is what the website lists and every
reader's store (*More plugins*) installs from (ADR 0023). A plugin gets
there with the upload form at <https://paperpaw.org/submit>: sign in
with a link sent by e-mail, upload the plugin's folder as a ZIP (and a
code plugin's builds), read the checks, complete the entry, look at the
preview, and send it to the moderators. (The paperpaw.org repository's
catalogue holds PaperPaw's own plugins only; it is not a way to
publish.)

Before that, `paperpaw-dev check` (and `paperpaw-dev package` for a
data plugin or a `.ppn` file) finds most of what the checks would refuse,
and what they cannot see: see [Checking your plugin](#checking-your-plugin).

An update is a new version with a higher number, the same way. The
site's guide for authors, <https://paperpaw.org/authors>, has every
field, check and limit; the skill's
[`publishing.md`](../.claude/skills/paperpaw-plugin-development/publishing.md)
walks an AI assistant helping an author through every step. In brief:

### What is uploaded

The plugin's folder as a ZIP, `plugin.ini` at its top (or inside one
folder at its top), its `id` and `version` the ones published. Outside
`store/` only `.ini`, `.css`, `.ttf`, `.otf`, `.ttc`, `.ppfp`, `.txt`,
`.md` and `.png` files, at most 64 (63 for a code plugin), their paths
of letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`, none starting with a dot, at most
100 bytes; at most 20 MB zipped, 40 MB unpacked.

A folder `store/` in it is for the store only, and is taken out of what
readers install: `store/store.ini` gives the summary, description,
group, tags, licence, source, SDK and translations, and names the
screenshots beside it.

```ini
[store]
summary = A large clock on the home screen, with the date below it.
group = home
tags = clock, widget
licence = MIT
source = https://codeberg.org/your-name/clock
sdk = 0.4

[source]
repository = https://codeberg.org/your-name/clock
revision = v1.0.0

[screenshots]
home.png = The home screen with the clock widget, on an Xteink X4.
```

It is PaperPaw's INI: a comment is a line of its own, never after a
value.

A code plugin adds one signed `.ppn` per reader (the form's fields
`build-x4`, `build-x4-pro`) and the exact source of
those builds: `[source]` names a public repository on `github.com`,
`codeberg.org` or `gitlab.com` and the tag or commit built (with `path`
and `bin` when the crate is not at the top or the binary not named as
its package), or the source goes up as a ZIP (`source-zip`).

### The author's key

Code plugins are signed by their author with an Ed25519 key of their
own, made once:

```sh
paperpaw-sign key ~/.paperpaw/author.key     # prints the public key, 64 hexadecimal digits
```

The file is the secret key: keep it outside every repository, keep a
copy apart, never commit or share it. In CI it is a secret of the
repository (`PAPERPAW_PLUGIN_KEY` in the sample's job); the site's page
<https://paperpaw.org/authors/sign> also signs in the browser, the key
never leaving the computer. The store reads the public key from the
builds: all of them are signed by one key, and every update by the same
one. Readers remember it at the first install and are warned when an
update is signed by another; a lost key is changed only in the open,
through the site's contact address.

### Builds that match their source

The site keeps each code plugin's source, shows it file by file, and
rebuilds each build in a container with the toolchain its fingerprint
names, with the sample's aliases (`cargo x4`, `cargo +esp x4pro`,
`--locked`). It compares the result byte for byte with the build
without its signature, and the plugin's page says *Verified: matches its
source*, *Not rebuilt* or *Rebuilt, but does not match its source*.
Paths end up in a build (in its panic messages), so the sample's
`build.sh` and the rebuild write them as the same everywhere, with
`--remap-path-prefix` added to the flags of `.cargo/config.toml`
(through `cargo --config`): the source's top as `/plugin` and Cargo's
home as `/cargo`. The core libraries come built, the same for everyone:
rustup's for the X4, the release's for the X4 Pro, which the rebuild
installs as authors do (see [The crate](#the-crate)). So:

- build with `build.sh`, or with the sample's CI job that runs it
  (`samples/hello-native/.github/workflows/build.yml`). Build from a
  pushed tag, in any folder, on Linux or macOS. On Windows, paths inside
  the source keep their `\`, and such a build matches only builds on
  Windows;
- commit `Cargo.lock`;
- keep the release's compilers pinned (`rust-toolchain.toml`, the job's
  `RUST_X4`, `RUST_X4_PRO`, `ESP_GCC`), its SDK
  (`paperpaw-sdk = "0.4"`) and, for the X4 Pro, its core libraries
  installed, and build again for every release until 1.0 (see
  [Which build fits](#which-build-fits));
- never set `RUSTFLAGS`, which would replace the flags that link the
  plugin, and never publish a build made without the remapped paths;
- put nothing of the moment or the computer into the code (a build
  script writing the time, a user name, a random value);
- name dependencies by version or a fixed commit, never a branch, and
  never by a `path` outside the repository (its folder is not remapped,
  and it changes the hashes Cargo gives every crate).

The sample's `build.sh`, which the job runs, builds both readers, packs
and signs the files, and zips the folder, with and without `store/`; the
job attaches them to the tag's release with their SHA-256. Building twice, in two folders, and
comparing the files with `cmp` shows that the build holds.
