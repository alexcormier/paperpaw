# Writing plugins

Everything PaperPaw shows and does comes from plugins: the home screen,
the reader, the library, the menus, the settings, even the keyboard. The
kernel only hosts them. A plugin you write can do anything these do, and
replace any of them.

There are two kinds:

- **Data plugins**: a folder with a `plugin.ini` and data files, no code.
  They bring translations (also whole new languages), key maps, new
  defaults for any setting, and fonts. They work on every device as they
  are; see [Plugins without code](#plugins-without-code).
- **Code plugins**: Rust crates against the SDK (`paperpaw-sdk`). They
  bring screens, actions, settings, formats, widgets, services, anything.
  They are compiled into a build of PaperPaw, or built into a file that
  the Xteink X4 and X4 Pro load at their start, without a new firmware
  (see [Plugins as files](#plugins-as-files)).

This guide walks through a code plugin, then lists what plugins can
contribute. Working with an AI assistant: the skill in
[`.claude/skills/paperpaw-plugin-development`](../.claude/skills/paperpaw-plugin-development/SKILL.md)
tells it how to write a plugin for PaperPaw as it is (without changing
PaperPaw), try it in the emulator and on an X4, and measure it; copy the
folder into a plugin's own project (or one's own skills) to use it
there. The SDK's API documentation (`cargo doc -p paperpaw-sdk
--open`) has every detail.

## The sample plugin

[`samples/hello-plugin`](../samples/hello-plugin/src/lib.rs) is a small
plugin to start from. It adds *Hello* to the tools menu, which opens a
screen greeting you by a name set in the settings, with the number of
books opened since the start. Try it in the emulator:

```sh
cargo run -p paperpaw-emulator --features hello -- --profile boox-go-7 --set hello.name=Ada
```

Open the main menu (a tap at the bottom of the home screen), then
*Tools*, then *Hello*.

### The plugin

A plugin is a type implementing [`Plugin`]: a manifest and a `register`
function. `register` runs once at start-up and adds the plugin's
contributions through a [`Registrar`]:

```rust
pub const PLUGIN: Id = Id::new_static("hello");
pub const OPEN: Id = Id::new_static("hello.open");
pub const SCREEN: Id = Id::new_static("hello.screen");

pub struct Hello;

impl Plugin for Hello {
    fn manifest(&self) -> Manifest {
        Manifest {
            id: PLUGIN,
            name: Cow::Borrowed("Hello"),
            description: Cow::Borrowed("A sample plugin to start from."),
            version: Version::new(0, 1, 0),
            sdk: SDK_VERSION,
            uses: paperpaw_sdk::Uses::NOTHING,
        }
    }

    fn register(&self, r: &mut Registrar) -> Result<(), RegisterError> {
        r.add_action(ActionSpec::new(OPEN, "hello.title").handler(|_, out| {
            out.push(Command::OpenScreen(SCREEN, Params::new()));
        }))?;
        r.add_menu_entry(MenuEntry { menu: menus::TOOLS, item: OPEN, order: 90 })?;
        r.add_icon(OPEN, Cow::Borrowed("star"))?;
        // … the screen, a setting, an event, translations
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

Every id starts with the plugin's id (`hello.open`); `core` is the
kernel's. Titles are translation keys, translated where they are shown.

Icons are named as in [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons), any of
them (`paperpaw_sdk::icons` knows every name). PaperPaw's icon font holds
the ones it uses itself; for another, bring its drawing as an icon pack
(see below), else none shows.

### Reading and changing: `Env` and commands

Plugins never change the kernel's state directly. They read it through
[`Env`]: the device, the settings, the translations, the fonts, the
storage, the time, the battery, the passwords and keys. They change it
with [`Command`]s: open a screen or slot, go back, change a setting,
emit an event, run an action, show a short message, make an HTTP
request, keep a password, and so on. The kernel runs the commands after
the plugin's code returns.

This keeps plugins simple to test and the API message-based, so the same
model works for sandboxed plugins later.

### Screens

A screen implements [`Screen`]. `draw` paints it; `on_action` reacts to
actions (from buttons, or gestures bound to them); `on_gesture` to taps,
long presses and swipes; `on_event` to events while it is open:

```rust
impl Screen for HelloScreen {
    fn draw(&mut self, canvas: &mut Canvas<'_>, env: &Env<'_>) {
        let title = env.i18n.tr("hello.title");
        self.header.draw(canvas, env, &self.style, title, None, None);
        // … the greeting, centred below
    }

    fn on_action(&mut self, action: &Id, cx: &mut Cx<'_, '_>) -> Handled {
        if *action == actions::CONFIRM || *action == actions::BACK {
            cx.command(Command::Back);
            return Handled::Yes;
        }
        Handled::No
    }

    fn on_gesture(&mut self, gesture: Gesture, cx: &mut Cx<'_, '_>) -> Handled {
        // A tap on the header's back arrow, or anywhere else, closes it.
    }
}
```

Screens are made by a factory each time they open
(`r.add_screen(ScreenSpec { id, title, factory })`). Return
`Handled::No` for what a screen does not handle: the kernel then runs
the action's own handler (e.g. the menu button opens the menu).

Some rules every screen should follow:

- **Touch and buttons alike.** Some devices have only buttons (the
  Xteink X4), some mostly touch (the Boox). Everything must be easy with
  either: buttons move a focus and confirm, taps act at once. Show the
  focus only once buttons are used (`ListView::focus_on_keys`).
- **`draw` only draws.** On small devices a frame is drawn in bands
  (the X4 draws five), so `draw` runs several times for one frame, and
  again for every frame after it: whatever it reads or works out, it
  does over and over. Load what a screen shows when it opens or when
  that changes (in its factory, `on_show`, `on_event`); parse it, sort
  it, wrap long texts and make pictures small (`ui::Thumbnail`) then,
  keep the result in the screen, and only draw it in `draw`, which must
  not change state. It can skip what lies outside `canvas.clip()`. The
  one thing read while drawing is a picture too large to keep, such as
  one filling the screen: `ui::draw_image` reads its rows band by band.
  The emulator's `--trace` shows what each band of a frame reads;
  `crates/paperpaw-app/tests/draw.rs` checks every screen of the
  standard app.
- **Ask for redraws.** After a change, `cx.request_redraw()` (or a part
  of the screen) and `cx.request_refresh(mode)`: `Fast` for a moving
  focus, `Partial` for new content, `Full` to clear ghosting.
- **Overlays** are screens with a `region`. One that takes the reader's
  attention (a menu, a question) washes out what lies below it
  (`dims_below`); one looked through (a keyboard over the field it
  types into, a notice) does not. A screen whose content is best in
  grays (a picture) says so (`grays`): panels with few grays then show
  it in more, as slowly as a full refresh.
- **Use the SDK's UI parts** (`paperpaw_sdk::ui`): headers, rows, lists,
  switches, numbers with − and +, messages, icons. They follow the user's
  appearance settings and line up with the rest of PaperPaw. What a
  screen draws itself takes its look from `UiStyle`: the focus with
  `ui::draw_focus`, what is on a focused row in `style.focus_ink(focused)`
  (white on the dark bar, black on a frame or a light bar), small shapes
  with `style.radius(height)` (pills where corners are round), boxes and
  cards with `style.corner`, lines between rows with `ui::draw_separator`.

Screens say what they show, for reading the interface aloud,
automation and tests: the `ui` helpers (list rows, buttons, switches,
headers, labels) tell what they draw by themselves. A screen that draws
in its own way tells it with `canvas.describe(role, text, area,
focused, on)`.

### Settings

A setting is a constant with its id and the type of its value
(`Setting<bool>`, `Setting<i64>` or `Setting<Text>` for choices,
languages, lists and text):

```rust
pub const NAME: Setting<Text> = Setting::new("hello.name");

r.add_setting(
    SettingSpec::text(&NAME, "hello.setting.name", "")
        .group(groups::OTHER)
        .description("hello.setting.name.help"),
)?;

let name: &str = env.settings.read(&NAME);
out.push(Command::set(&NAME, "Ada".into()));
```

`SettingSpec::switch`, `number`, `choice`, `language`, `list` and
`text` make the others, their defaults of the setting's type. The
settings screens list every setting by its group, with its description
below it; the kernel saves changes to `paperpaw.ini`. Settings can be
numbers with units and steps, switches, choices, languages or text;
`advanced()` hides rarely needed ones, `scoped()` lets one be set per
book, `editor(screen)` opens a screen of your own instead. Settings
known only at run time (one per widget, say) are read by their ids,
`env.settings.text("…")` and so on. Passwords and keys do not belong in
settings: see [Passwords and keys](#passwords-and-keys).

Each setting built this way takes about 200 bytes while the device
runs. A plugin with many settings keeps them in the program instead, in
a `static` list (on the X4 it stays in flash, next to no memory):

```rust
const GROUP: Id = Id::new_static("hello.clock");
static SETTINGS: [SettingSpec; 2] = [
    SettingSpec::fixed_switch("hello.clock.date", "hello.setting.date", true, GROUP),
    SettingSpec::fixed_choice("hello.clock.face", "hello.setting.face",
        &["hello.face.plain", "hello.face.ticks"], "hello.face.ticks", GROUP)
        .described("hello.setting.face.help"),
];

r.add_settings(&SETTINGS)?;
```

Such settings are read like any other; those that need a unit, a step,
a section or an editor screen are made as above.

### Events

```rust
r.on(events::BOOK_OPENED, move |env, reading, out| {
    opened.set(opened.get() + 1);
    // reading.path, reading.title, reading.progress, reading.at() …
})?;
```

The kernel and plugins emit events; any plugin can listen. An `Event<P>`
names an event and what it carries, a struct made with `event_data!`,
so emitting (`EVENT.emit(data)`) and hearing (`r.on`) are checked as
the plugin is built; screens get every event too and read one with
`EVENT.read(event, params)` in `Screen::on_event`. Standard ones are in
`builtin::events`: started, a setting changed, a book opened, a page
turned, a book moved, books came into the library or left it, its
bookmarks or highlights changed, a word looked up, a place in the open
book to show, text chosen, notes exported, the device suspends or
resumes. Plugins define their own the same way (in their namespace),
and `EVENT.schedule(data, at)` emits one at a time (work at a time,
below). Underneath, what events carry travels as named
strings (`Params`): events known only at run time are heard by id with
`r.subscribe`.

Answers come as events too, typed in `replies`: a plugin names the
event it wants, e.g. `const FETCHED: Event<HttpReply> =
Event::new("news.fetched")`, and passes it with the request. To ask
the reader, `ask::text("Server", &ENTERED).initial(url).command()`
opens the keyboard and brings back a `Typed`, `ask::folder` a
`Chosen`, and `choice::open` a `Picked`. What the plugin added
(`.with(key, value)`) comes back as the answer's `context`, to tell
its questions apart.

What is known of books is a service, not a screen's: `library` has a
book's details (title, author, series, tags, cover, progress, and
fields plugins add with `library::set_field`), the books read last and
the favourites, so any plugin can show or use them. Views of many books
show covers made small and kept on the storage (`library::cover`, a few
kilobytes each, not the picture) and take a book's details with the
size a listing told (`library::listing`, `library::book_sized`): on a
card, each file looked up again is a search through its folder.

The bookmarks and highlights of books are shared: `annotations` reads
and keeps them, and whoever changes them emits
`annotations::changed(book)`, so the reader shows them anew and syncs
pass them on (the `koreader` plugin, for example).

State a plugin keeps between events lives in an `Rc` it hands to its
handlers when it registers.

### Translations

```ini
[meta]
language = en
name = English
plural = one-other

[messages]
hello.title = Hello
# {name} is the name set, {count} the books opened since the start.
hello.greeting.one = Hello, {name}! You opened {count} book.
hello.greeting.other = Hello, {name}! You opened {count} books.
```

Every text a plugin shows comes from catalogs like this, added with
`r.add_translations(…)`; English first, then any other language. `tr`
translates, `format` fills `{placeholders}`, `plural` picks the form for
a number. A test that all languages have the same keys belongs in every
plugin (see the sample).

### Testing

Plugins are tested with the real kernel and an in-memory storage, as the
sample's [test](../samples/hello-plugin/tests/hello.rs) does: build a
kernel with the plugin, send it input, look at the open screen, the
settings, the files, the HTTP requests it makes (`Kernel::take_io`)
and answer them (`Kernel::http_response`). The emulator then shows how it
looks and how much memory it needs on each device:

```sh
cargo run -p paperpaw-emulator -- --profile xteink-x4 --headless --script "confirm" --screenshot out.png
```

## What plugins contribute

| Contribution | Registrar | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Actions | `add_action` | Something to do, bound to buttons and gestures, listed in menus |
| Screens | `add_screen` | Full screens and overlays (menus, dialogs, panels) |
| Slots | `add_slot`, `bind_slot` | Roles a screen fills: home, reader, library, menu, settings, keyboard, dictionary, … |
| Menu entries and sections | `add_menu_entry`, `add_menu_section` | Actions, settings and submenus in any menu |
| Icons | `add_icon` | The icon of an action, setting group or menu |
| Settings and groups | `add_setting`, `add_setting_group` | Shown and saved by the kernel |
| Setting defaults | `set_setting_default` | New defaults for other plugins' settings (themes) |
| Event handlers | `subscribe` | React to events |
| Key maps | `add_keymap`, `add_keymap_preset`, `add_keymap_when` | What buttons, taps and swipes do; bindings that apply while a switch is on |
| Formats | `add_format` | Open a kind of file as a document to read; big pictures may be decoded when their page shows (`Document::prepare_image`) |
| Fonts | `add_font`, `add_font_file`, `bind_font` | Fonts and the roles they fill |
| Hyphenation | `add_hyphenation` | Patterns for a language |
| Text filters | `add_text_filter` | Change a book's text before it is laid out |
| Decorators | `add_decorator` | Mark words on book pages (a background, a line, a frame), drawn the same by every reader |
| Input filters | `add_input_filter` | See every button and finger first: pass it, take it, or run an action instead |
| Refresh filters | `add_refresh_filter` | Change how the panel is refreshed, e.g. in full on a screen of your own |
| Status items and lines | `add_status_item`, `add_status_line` | What status lines show |
| Widgets | `add_widget` | Blocks for the home screen and the sleep screen |
| Setup steps | `add_setup_step` | A page of the first-run setup: a setting to choose or a screen of the plugin's, where the device needs it |
| Services | `publish` | Anything one plugin offers others, found with `env.services.get` |
| Contributions | `contribute` | Additions to a point another plugin defined |
| Translations | `add_translations` | Catalogs for any language |
| Book data | `add_book_data` | Where the plugin keeps something for each book (named by `library::key`): moved and removed with the book, cleaned up when it is gone |

Slots are how a plugin replaces another: bind your screen to
`core.home` and it is the home screen; the user's
`[slots]` configuration has the final word. Built-in slots are in
`builtin::slots`, built-in menus in `builtin::menus`: the main menu
(`core.main`), its tools (`core.tools`) and the settings' pages
(`core.settings-pages`).

### What every reader offers

A plugin that works with books never names the reader plugin: it uses
what `builtin` defines for every reader, so a reader of one's own (bound
to `core.reader`) replaces the shipped one in full.

| What | Standard | |
|---|---|---|
| Show a place in the open book, a part marked | `events::GOTO` (`Goto`) | readers take it; tables of contents, bookmarks, search and syncs send it |
| Text chosen, and the action chosen for it | `menus::SELECTION`, `events::TEXT_CHOSEN` | add an action to the menu, hear the event |
| Notes exported as Markdown | `events::NOTES_EXPORTED` | for notes apps and syncs |
| The reader's menus | `menus::READER`, `READER_MORE`, `READER_PANEL` | add entries there |
| Font size | `settings::FONT_SIZE` | the kernel's setting, which readers read |
| Status lines' settings | `groups::STATUS_LINES` | the group readers put them in |
| Reading aloud's settings | `setting_sections::ALOUD` | the section readers and shells put them in |
| Key bindings while reading | the layer `[keymap.core.reader]` | the slot's layer, whichever screen fills it |

A reader in turn sends the reading events (`BOOK_OPENED`, `PAGE_TURNED`,
`BOOK_CLOSED`, `BOOK_FINISHED`), takes `GOTO`, and offers its actions
in these menus.

### Services and points of your own

A plugin can offer others more than the kernel knows of. A service is
any value published under an id in its namespace, usually a trait
object whose trait the plugin's crate exports; others use it when it is
there and do without it when not:

```rust
// The publishing plugin.
r.publish(WEATHER, Box::new(Forecast::new()) as Box<dyn Weather>)?;

// Any other plugin, wherever it has an `Env`.
if let Some(weather) = env.services.get::<Box<dyn Weather>>(WEATHER.as_str()) {
    let today = weather.today();
}
```

A service is found by its type's name too, so native code plugins built
apart from the firmware find it (see *Plugins as files* below). When
the type of a service changes, give it a new id (`weather.forecast-2`):
its name alone would not tell.

A point is an id a plugin names, with what a contribution there is in
its documentation (for example one line per entry); others add to it
with `r.contribute(point, text)`, and the plugin reads
`env.services.contributions(point)`, each with the plugin it came from.

### Marks in the text

A plugin marks words on book pages with a decorator (ADR 0021): it gets
the words of a page with their places in the book and gives back ranges,
each with a *role*. The reader draws them; the plugin knows neither the
reader nor the panel.

```rust
use paperpaw_sdk::decorations::{self, Decorated, Decoration, DecoratorSpec, LineKind};

const LEARNING: Id = Id::new_static("vocabulary.learning");

// The role: its look is settings (Settings, Marks in the text), the
// plugin gives the default; themes and users change it.
decorations::add_role(r, &LEARNING, "vocabulary.role.learning",
    Decoration::NONE.line(LineKind::Dotted))?;
r.add_decorator(
    DecoratorSpec::new(Id::new_static("vocabulary.words"), "vocabulary.decorator",
        |env, page| {
            page.words
                .iter()
                .filter(|w| is_learnt(env, w.text))
                .filter_map(|w| Decorated::words(core::slice::from_ref(w), &LEARNING))
                .collect()
        })
    .switch(&MARK)          // a bool setting turns it on and off
    .taps()                 // taps on its marks come back
    .signature(|env| words_changed(env)),
)?;
r.on(events::DECORATION_TAPPED, |env, tapped, out| { /* tapped.text */ })?;
```

- A `Decoration` is a background, the text's ink, a line under the text
  (solid, dotted, dashed, wavy, double) with its tone and thickness, a
  frame, struck through; tones are named, and each panel shows them as
  well as it can (colours, or their lightness, dithered where there are
  few grays).
- Each aspect of a role is a setting of its own (`<role>.background`,
  `.ink`, `.line`, `.line-tone`, `.thickness`, `.frame`, `.struck`), so
  profiles, rules and themes set them like any other.
- Decorators are asked once a page is laid out, and again when their
  signature changes (their data, their settings): keep it cheap, and
  never work on a whole book.
- Where marks meet on a word, the earlier decorator (by `order`) wins an
  aspect both set; the rest combine.
- The reader's own marks are roles too: `roles::HIGHLIGHT`, `LINK`,
  `SEARCH_HIT`, `ALOUD`. A reader of one's own draws all marks with
  `decorations::draw_behind` and `draw_over`.
- What changes widths (bold, a larger size) is a text filter instead: it
  lays the page out again.

### Widgets

A widget is a [`Widget`] a screen makes and keeps
(`env.widgets.make`): it reads what it shows in `update`, which the
screen calls when it shows the widget, about each minute and after
events, and only draws in `draw` (which runs for every band of a
frame). The screen tells it where it goes (`place`) before drawing it
there: what is made for that size, such as a cover made small
(`ui::Thumbnail`), is made then, and again in `update` when what it
shows changed. Register it with `WidgetSpec::new(id, title, factory)`; a widget
with nothing to read, such as a clock, is a pair of functions
(`WidgetSpec::drawn` with `Drawn::new(height, draw)`, and `shows` to be
drawn again when what it shows changes). A widget whose content changes
only after events (books, settings) says so (`live` false) and is not
read again each minute; one that can be drawn smaller says how small
(`min_height`), so that a grid fits it where its full height has no
room. `widgets::grid` puts widgets
and tools in a grid as the home screen does, edited in place
(`GridView`). Say which kind a widget is
(`.category(widgets::categories::TIME)`, or `BOOKS`, `READING`, `WORDS`,
`PERSONAL`, `WORLD`, `DEVICE`): the home screen offers widgets by their
kind, each drawn as it would show.

### Widgets with settings

A widget may have settings of its own, such as where its text sits. Put
them in a settings group with the widget's id
(`widgets::settings_group`); the settings list leaves such groups out,
and the home screen's editor offers them as the widget's *Settings*. For
the alignment there is a ready setting: register
`widgets::align_setting(&id, Align::Left)` and place each text with
`widgets::align(env, id).x(area, width)`.

Widgets of all plugins share a look the reader shapes for each, so that
they sit well together on a page: give yours a frame and draw in it.

```rust
const ID: Id = Id::new_static("my.card");
static SETTINGS: [SettingSpec; 4] = [
    widgets::align_spec("my.card.align", ID, Align::Left),
    widgets::frame_spec("my.card.frame", ID, Frame::None), // none, line, light or dark card
    widgets::size_spec("my.card.size", ID, Size::Medium, true), // true: also "as large as it fits"
    widgets::part_spec("my.card.author", ID, "my.show-author", true),
];
r.add_setting_group(widgets::settings_group(&ID, "my.card"))?;
r.add_settings(&SETTINGS)?;

fn draw(&self, canvas: &mut Canvas<'_>, env: &Env<'_>, area: Rect) {
    let look = widgets::draw_frame(canvas, env, ID.as_str(), area);
    let rest = widgets::draw_caption(canvas, env, ID.as_str(), &look, "Today");
    let size = widgets::size(env, ID.as_str()).text(&UiStyle::new(env));
    // ... the content in `rest`, in `look.ink` (and `look.faint` for
    // what matters less), never in a fixed black: on a dark card it is
    // light.
}
```

A widget may be placed more than once, each placement with its own
values of the widget's settings: the home screen places a clock as
`widgets.clock@1` and `widgets.clock@2`, whose frames are the settings
`widgets.clock@1.frame` and `widgets.clock@2.frame` (saved like any
other, the widget's own `widgets.clock.frame` where one sets none).
`env.widgets.make` gives a placement's widget, which reads its settings
by their usual ids and gets that placement's values
(`Settings::with_placement`); a widget need do nothing for it. Screens
of their own that place widgets use `Id::placement` and forget a
placement's values when it goes (`Settings::placement_values`).

`widgets::shows(env, id, "author")` reads a part's switch,
`widgets::choice` makes other choices of the widget's own, and
`widgets::draw_message` says kindly what is not there yet. A widget's
`height` counts its frame (`widgets::look::look` gives the area inside
it without drawing). For round things there are `Canvas::fill_circle`,
`stroke_circle`, `fill_ring` (arcs, e.g. a progress ring) and
`draw_hand`, with angles as on a clock face (`paperpaw_sdk::round`);
light grays are drawn with `fill_shaded` or `fill_round_shaded`, which
dither them on black and white panels.

Screens that place widgets one below the other should know the kernel's
two widgets for room between them: `widgets::SPACE` is an ordinary
widget, a gap; `widgets::FILL` has no height of its own and takes its
share of the room the others leave (`widgets::fill_height`). Both may
be in a list more than once (`widgets::repeatable`).

### Presets and home screen layouts

A preset is a ready-made set of setting values chosen as a whole
(`paperpaw_sdk::presets`), such as a layout of the home screen. It has a
kind, named by the plugin that offers such presets: the home screen
offers those of `home.layout` in its chooser (in the first-run setup,
and under *Add* while editing it), shows each on itself before it is
kept, and applies the one chosen. Add presets kept in the program with
`Registrar::add_presets` (a `static` list of `Preset::fixed`), for your
own kind or another plugin's:

```rust
static LAYOUTS: [Preset; 1] = [Preset::fixed(
    "my.nook",
    "home.layout",
    "my.nook",      // translation keys of its name
    "my.nook.help", // and of a sentence on it
    "home.page-1 = widgets.word-clock@1 0/0 4x2, home.continue@1 0/2 4x2
home.rows = 6",
)];

r.add_presets(&LAYOUTS)?;
```

A layout sets the pages (`home.page-1` to `home.page-4`, as
`widgets::grid` writes them) and whatever of the home screen's look it
wants (`home.columns`, `home.rows`, `home.status-bar`,
`home.footer.dots` ...); what it leaves out goes back to its default.
Widgets placed as `id@1` have settings of their own in it
(`home.recent@1.count = 8`), so a layout gives them their looks without
touching the widget's other placements. To offer presets of a kind of
your own, list them (`env.settings.presets().of_kind(kind)`), work out
what one changes (`Preset::changes` with the settings it covers), show
it (`Command::PreviewSettings`: the values show on every screen without
being kept, until the screen that asked closes) and keep it
(`presets::commands`).

### Passwords and keys

Plugins keep passwords, API keys and tokens with
`Command::SetSecret(SecretChange::keep(id, label, value))` and read them
with `env.secrets.get(id)`. They are all listed in *Settings, Passwords
and keys*, where the user changes or removes them. Ask for one on the
keyboard in password mode (`params::MODE` `password`); the keyboard
offers to type it on a phone. They are kept apart from the settings and
not readable at a glance, but not encrypted: the devices have no safe
place for a key.

### The network

`Command::Http(HttpRequest::get(url, &FETCHED))` makes a request where
the device has a network (`env.caps.network`); the answer comes as the
request's reply event, an `HttpReply` with the status and the body, or
saved to a file (`.save_to(path)`) for large ones. A request may set a
`timeout`, the answer's headers it wants back (`want_headers`) and the
longest body kept in memory (`max_body`, by default 64 KiB on small
devices). Every request is answered once, also when it is refused
(`HttpReply::refused` says why and when to try again). The manifest says
that the plugin uses the network (`uses: Uses::NETWORK`); without it,
requests are refused. In Offline (`env.power`), only what the reader went
online for goes out: a screen that needs the network says so on itself
and offers *Go online*, which sends `Command::GoOnline` (the network for
that screen until it closes); anything else is refused with
`Reason::Offline` and may try again on `events::WORK_ALLOWED`.
`Command::CancelHttp` takes requests back.

### Work in the background

What a plugin does on its own, not because the reader just asked for
it, it declares as work (`paperpaw_sdk::work`, ADR 0025), and the
kernel runs it at the moment that costs least: waking, a book opened or
closed, going to sleep, the radio on anyway, charging, idle.
`Command::Work(Work::network(PUSH).within(Duration::from_secs(1800))
.at_moments(Moments::BOOK_CLOSED | Moments::SLEEP))` sends the reading
position when the book is closed or the device sleeps, at the latest
after half an hour; the kernel then emits the work's event and the
plugin makes its request. `optional()` work (weather, headlines) runs
only while that is cheap, and never brings the radio on by itself.
`Work::at(event, time)` is a timer, `every` repeats, `key` tells
several works of one event apart, `Command::CancelWork` takes one back.
`env.reader` says whether what is handled is the reader's own doing: an
action the reader ran acts at once, the same action run by a rule
declares `Work::when_cheap(id, within)` instead and waits for a good
moment.
Long work in steps (an install, a catalog walked) registers its step
function (`r.add_work(WorkSpec::new(id, title, step))`) and is stepped
between frames. `env.work` says where a work stands, for the plugin's
own page; background work never shows a notice over reading. The power
mode (`env.power`) makes deadlines longer or holds network work back;
most plugins need not read it.
Read large JSON answers as they stream with `paperpaw_json::stream`
(the crate `paperpaw-json`), so they
need little memory. `Command::Serve` serves HTTP to the local network,
e.g. for transfers from a computer or typing on a phone; what happens
to it comes as `ServerNotice`s, and to sockets (`Command::Connect`,
`Command::Broadcast`) as `SocketNotice`s.

### Firmware updates

Where PaperPaw is the device's firmware (the X4), `env.firmware` says
which version runs and how an install goes; elsewhere it is `None`.
`Command::Firmware(FirmwareCommand::Install { path })` installs a
signed update file, `FirmwareCommand::Restart` restarts into it once
`FirmwareState::Installed`; `events::FIRMWARE_CHANGED` comes on the
way. `firmware::Update::read` tells what a file holds before. The
`update` plugin does all this for update files on the card; a plugin
that fetches updates from somewhere else only needs to put the file
there.

## Memory

The smallest device, the Xteink X4, has 256 KiB of heap for everything.
A plugin that should run there:

- keeps little in memory: lists in files, read as they are needed;
- reads files a piece at a time (`Storage::read_at`), never whole books;
- writes downloads straight to storage (`HttpRequest::save_to`);
- reserves large buffers with `try_reserve` and copes when that fails;
- checks `env.device.memory` (`MemoryClass::Small`) to do less there.

The emulator's X4 profile enforces the budget, and `--heap-report` shows
where memory goes.

## Plugins as files

A code plugin can also be a file, `code.ppn`, in a plugin's folder on
the card, which the X4 and the X4 Pro load at their start (ADR 0024):
from the plugin store or from the web flasher with the firmware. Only
code installed runs: an installer names the file by its digest
(`native::remember_code`, kept in `.paperpaw` where neither the Wi-Fi
transfer nor plugins' folders reach), and a file put into a plugin's
folder otherwise is not run (the plugin manager says why); an author
trying their own build names it over USB
(`tools/x4-remote.py --trust-code <id>`). Its code is the same as that of a plugin built in, and it runs
as part of PaperPaw, at full speed and without a sandbox: it can do
whatever PaperPaw can, also past the SDK. The X4 Pro runs it from its
PSRAM; the X4 writes it once into flash behind its firmware (about 1.8
MB for all its plugins together) and runs it from there, for some
hundred bytes of RAM.

[`samples/hello-native`](../samples/hello-native) is the sample plugin
above as a file, in a workspace of its own as a plugin's own repository
is, with a CI job to start from.

### The crate

The plugin stays a library crate, tried in the emulator and tested as
any other. A second crate, a `#![no_std]`, `#![no_main]` binary, makes
the file with one line:

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

paperpaw_sdk::plugin!(my_plugin::MyPlugin::default());
```

`plugin!` gives the file its entry, its heap (the kernel's: what the
plugin boxes, the kernel may drop) and its panic handler. The crate's
`.cargo/config.toml` links it as a plugin: copy the sample's, which
links with `paperpaw-plugin.x` (the SDK brings it), keeps the
relocations, and on the X4 builds with the medium code model and frame
pointers. Build it for both chips:

```sh
cargo x4                  # riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf, the X4
cargo +esp x4pro          # xtensa-esp32s3-none-elf, the X4 Pro (espup's toolchain)
```

### Which build fits

Until PaperPaw 1.0 a plugin file runs only on the PaperPaw it was built
for: the same compiler for the same chip from the same SDK with the same
features. Its fingerprint says so, and a device loads only files with
its own; *About* shows the device's fingerprint and the compiler to
build with. Build against the SDK of the release (`paperpaw-sdk = "0.5"`)
with the toolchain that release names, and build again for every
release; the store and the update check show which plugins wait for a
build. From 1.0 on, plugins will be built against a versioned interface
and keep working across minor releases.

### Packing and signing

`paperpaw-sign` (in this repository, `tools/sign`) makes the file from
the linked plugin and signs it as its author:

```sh
paperpaw-sign key author.key                      # once; keep it safe, never publish it
paperpaw-sign pack target/riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf/release/my-plugin my-plugin-x4.ppn --key author.key
paperpaw-sign plugin my-plugin-x4.ppn             # what it holds, and who signed it
```

`pack` refuses what cannot run from where the file lands: writable data
(a `static` that changes; keep state on the heap, as in `Rc`s handed to
closures), symbols it cannot find, and code that reaches an address
fixed in the firmware or ROM directly. The signature goes into the file
itself, so it travels with it; a device remembers the author's key at
the first install and warns when an update is signed by another.

### Trying it on a device

A code plugin is a folder like a data plugin's, with its code beside its
`plugin.ini`:

```text
plugins/my-plugin/
  plugin.ini     [plugin] id, name, description, version
  code.ppn       its code, for this device and this firmware
  i18n/*.ini     translations, settings.ini, … as for data plugins
```

Copy the folder onto the card (over USB: `python tools/x4-remote.py
--push my-plugin plugins/my-plugin`) and restart. The plugin manager
lists it as one with code, and says why one does not run (built for
another PaperPaw, damaged, no room). Over USB, `native` (and `--info`)
says where each plugin lies and what loading it took.

A panic's calls inside a plugin are kept with its name and the offset
into its file, e.g. `4261a402 (my-plugin+0x452)`: its function lies at
`0x42000000 + offset - 80` in the plugin's ELF. A plugin that crashes
before PaperPaw shows its first frame is switched off: after two such
starts PaperPaw starts without plugins with code and says so (holding
*Back* on the X4, *Home* on the X4 Pro, while switching it on does the
same). The plugins it switched off are switched on again in the plugin
manager, one at a time.

### Keeping it small

On the X4 every plugin's file takes room in flash. A plugin carries its
own copy of the SDK code it uses, which is most of a small plugin: of
the sample's 63 KB on the X4, its own code is some 9 KB.

- Build with `opt-level = "s"` (as PaperPaw) or `"z"` (some 5 % smaller
  on the X4, a little slower), `lto = "fat"`, `codegen-units = 1`,
  `panic = "abort"`, as the sample does.
- Leave out what pulls in large parts of `core`: parsing floats from
  text (`str::parse::<f32>()`, 16 KB of tables), `{:?}` of strings.
- Keep translations and other text in the folder's files rather than in
  the code, where they are needed once.

Services between plugins are found by their type's name too, so a plugin
built apart finds those of the firmware's plugins (see [Services and
points of your own](#services-and-points-of-your-own)).

### Publishing a code plugin

The plugin library (paperpaw.org) lists a code plugin with its folder
and a build per reader (`x4`, `x4-pro`, `x4-classic`), each a signed
`.ppn` with the fingerprint it was built for, the author's key, and its
source, which the library rebuilds to compare. The sample's `build.sh`
builds, packs and signs both files, and its CI job
(`samples/hello-native/.github/workflows/build.yml`, for a plugin's own
repository) runs it on every tag, with the author's key kept as a
secret of the repository. [Publishing](#publishing) says how.

## Plugins without code

A data plugin is a folder:

```text
plugins/large-print/
  plugin.ini     [plugin] id, name, description, version, formats
  i18n/*.ini     translation catalogs (also whole new languages)
  keymap.ini     key bindings
  settings.ini   new defaults for any plugin's settings ([reader] font-size = 14)
  fonts/*.ttf    fonts to read with (also .otf, .ttc), by family
  fonts/*.ppfp   packs with letters other fonts lack, named in plugin.ini:
                 [extends] cyrillic.ppfp = fonts-default.literata
  fonts/…        a family's faces, named in plugin.ini: [family] name,
                 regular, bold, italic, bold-italic (packs, or .ttf/.otf
                 where scalable fonts are drawn)
  styles.css     a stylesheet for books, after a book's own (EPUB)
  presets.ini    ready-made sets of settings, e.g. home screen layouts
```

`formats` says which version of these files' formats the plugin is made
for (1 now, and if it is left out); a PaperPaw that reads an older one
leaves the plugin out and says why, rather than reading it wrongly.

Packs for other scripts (`tools/script-pack.py` builds Cyrillic and
Greek for Literata) are read a glyph at a time, so devices with little
memory can use them ([ADR 0018](adr/0018-font-packs-for-other-scripts.md)).
Icon packs are such packs for the icon font: `tools/icons/pack.py` builds
one with the Tabler icons named
(`[extends] icons.ppfp = fonts-default.icons`).

A family of its own needs a name and a regular face; its faces are
packs, drawn on every device and read a glyph at a time, or font files,
drawn where scalable fonts are, a variable font at its style's weight:

```ini
[family]
name = Fredoka
regular = regular.ppfp
bold = bold.ppfp
```

A logo of its own takes the place of PaperPaw's (on the sleep screen,
the About page and the logo widget): a picture in the folder, named in
`settings.ini`:

```ini
[core]
logo = plugins/my-brand/logo.png
```

A theme is a `settings.ini` with new defaults for the appearance
settings (*Settings > Customise > Appearance*, most of them with
advanced settings): the header (`core.header.plain`, `.light`, `.dark`),
the corners (`core.corners.square`, `.small`, `.round`, `.soft`; round
and soft ones make buttons and switches pills), the highlight
(`core.focus.fill`, `.ring`, `.soft`), the lines between rows
(`core.separators.inset`, `.line`, `.none`), lists on cards
(`core.groups.cards`), the size of headers' titles, the margins, rows
and lines:

```ini
[core]
ui-focus = core.focus.ring
ui-separators = core.separators.none
ui-title = 140
ui-row = 180
```

Pebble, a theme with lists on cards for touch screens, comes with
PaperPaw, switched off in the plugin manager.

The fonts browser (`plugins/fonts-browser`) downloads fonts as such
plugins from paperpaw.org: font files for devices with scalable fonts
and the memory for them, packs for the others. The store
(`plugins/store`, *More plugins*) lists every other data plugin of the
plugin library made for the device and installs, updates and removes it
([ADR 0023](adr/0023-plugin-store.md)). Both build on the SDK's
`install` module: an `Installer` downloads a `Package`'s files one after
another into `plugins/.<id>.part`, checks each by its size and SHA-1,
then has the kernel install it (`Command::InstallPlugin`) in place of
every version of it before, what was chosen from it still chosen; the
job is kept on the storage, so it goes on with no screen open.

Copy it into the `plugins` folder of a device (or of the emulator's
library) and restart, or have a plugin load it at once
(`Command::LoadPlugin` with its folder; `Command::RemovePlugin` removes
one, its fonts and presets at once, the rest after the next start). A plugin's `styles.css` comes after a book's own
stylesheets and before one's own (`styles.css` beside the books, then
the one named like a book), so the more particular wins; plugins with
code add theirs with `Registrar::add_stylesheet`.

A `presets.ini` holds presets (see above), a section each: its `kind`,
its `name` and `description` (translation keys from its `i18n`, or the
text itself), then the settings it sets by their whole id:

```ini
[nook]
kind = home.layout
name = reading-nook.nook
description = reading-nook.nook.help
home.page-1 = widgets.word-clock@1 0/0 4x2, home.continue@1 0/2 4x2, home.recent@1 0/4 4x2
home.rows = 6
```

So anyone can make a home screen layout and share it: it is offered
with the home screen's own. [`samples/plugins`](../samples/plugins) has
five: large print, three themes (airy, paw, calm ink) and a layout
(reading nook).

## Publishing

The plugin library on paperpaw.org is what the website lists and every
reader's store (*More plugins*) installs from (ADR 0023). A plugin gets
there in one of two ways, both through the same checks:

- **The upload form** at <https://paperpaw.org/submit>, the main way:
  sign in with a link sent by e-mail, upload the plugin's folder as a
  ZIP (and a code plugin's builds), read the checks, complete the entry,
  look at the preview, and send it to the moderators.
- **A pull request** to the paperpaw.org repository that adds
  `catalogue/<id>.toml`, for developers.

An update is a new version with a higher number, the same way. The
site's guide for authors, <https://paperpaw.org/authors>, has every
field, check and limit; the skill's
[`publishing.md`](../.claude/skills/paperpaw-plugin-development/publishing.md)
walks an AI assistant helping an author through every step. In brief:

### What is uploaded

The plugin's folder as a ZIP, `plugin.ini` at its top (or inside one
folder at its top), its `id` and `version` the ones published. Outside
`store/` only `.ini`, `.css`, `.ttf`, `.otf`, `.ttc`, `.ppfp`, `.txt`,
`.md` and `.png` files, at most 64 (63 for a code plugin), their paths
of letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`, none starting with a dot, at most
100 bytes; at most 20 MB zipped, 40 MB unpacked.

A folder `store/` in it is for the store only, and is taken out of what
readers install: `store/store.ini` gives the summary, description,
group, tags, licence, source, SDK and translations, and names the
screenshots beside it.

```ini
[store]
summary = A large clock on the home screen, with the date below it.
group = home
tags = clock, widget
licence = MIT
source = https://codeberg.org/your-name/clock
sdk = 0.5

[source]
repository = https://codeberg.org/your-name/clock
revision = v1.0.0

[screenshots]
home.png = The home screen with the clock widget, on an Xteink X4.
```

It is PaperPaw's INI: a comment is a line of its own, never after a
value.

A code plugin adds one signed `.ppn` per reader (the form's fields
`build-x4`, `build-x4-pro`, `build-x4-classic`) and the exact source of
those builds: `[source]` names a public repository on `github.com`,
`codeberg.org` or `gitlab.com` and the tag or commit built (with `path`
and `bin` when the crate is not at the top or the binary not named as
its package), or the source goes up as a ZIP (`source-zip`).

### The author's key

Code plugins are signed by their author with an Ed25519 key of their
own, made once:

```sh
paperpaw-sign key ~/.paperpaw/author.key     # prints the public key, 64 hexadecimal digits
```

The file is the secret key: keep it outside every repository, keep a
copy apart, never commit or share it. In CI it is a secret of the
repository (`PAPERPAW_PLUGIN_KEY` in the sample's job); the site's page
<https://paperpaw.org/authors/sign> also signs in the browser, the key
never leaving the computer. The store reads the public key from the
builds: all of them are signed by one key, and every update by the same
one. Readers remember it at the first install and are warned when an
update is signed by another; a lost key is changed only in the open,
through the site's contact address.

### Builds that match their source

The site keeps each code plugin's source, shows it file by file, and
rebuilds each build in a container with the toolchain its fingerprint
names, with the sample's aliases (`cargo x4`, `cargo +esp x4pro`,
`--locked`). It compares the result byte for byte with the build
without its signature, and the plugin's page says *Verified: matches its
source*, *Not rebuilt* or *Rebuilt, but does not match its source*. The
rebuild runs in the paths of GitHub's runners, and paths end up in a
build, so:

- build with the sample's CI job
  (`samples/hello-native/.github/workflows/build.yml`) from a pushed
  tag;
- commit `Cargo.lock`;
- keep the release's compilers pinned (`rust-toolchain.toml`, the job's
  `RUST_X4`, `RUST_X4_PRO`, `ESP_GCC`) and its SDK
  (`paperpaw-sdk = "0.5"`);
- never set `RUSTFLAGS`, which would replace the flags that link the
  plugin;
- put nothing of the moment or the computer into the code (a build
  script writing the time, a user name, a random value);
- name dependencies by version or a fixed commit, never a branch.

The sample's `build.sh`, which the job runs, builds both readers, packs
and signs the files, and zips the folder, with and without `store/`; the
job attaches them to the tag's release with their SHA-256 and the
catalogue's `[[versions]]` for them.

### By pull request

`catalogue/<id>.toml` holds what `store.ini` would, and `author`,
`kind` and the versions; the folder lies at `catalogue/packages/<id>/`
(without `store/`) or elsewhere as a ZIP (`url`, `sha256`). A code
plugin adds `author_key`, `devices` (every reader with a build), and in
each version `[versions.source]` and a `[[versions.builds]]` per reader
with its `device`, its fingerprint as `abi` (which `paperpaw-sign
plugin` prints), and its file. `samples/hello-native/catalogue.toml` is
one to fill in; `paperpaw-website check` in a clone of the paperpaw.org
repository runs the site's checks on it.

[`Plugin`]: ../crates/paperpaw-sdk/src/plugin.rs

Other protocols go over sockets ([ADR 0014](adr/0014-sockets-for-plugins.md)):
`Command::Connect` opens a TCP connection, `Command::SocketSend` sends,
and `Command::SocketRead` asks for what comes next, as text
(`SocketRead::Text`) or as a file of a known length written to storage as
it comes (`SocketRead::File`), so files of any size never need to fit in
memory. `Command::Broadcast` finds services in the local network by a
UDP datagram and their answers. Everything comes back as events
(`socket_params`); a socket closes when the screen showing as it was
opened is closed.
