# Transfer over USB and plugins from a computer

A computer can install a plugin on a PaperPaw device, or add books to it,
over the USB cable or over the Wi-Fi transfer page. Both ways use the same
requests and the same install routine. Nothing is written before the
reader agrees on the device.

This page is for those who write such a computer program (the workshop,
a page in a browser with Web Serial, a script). `tools/usb-transfer.py`
is a small client to read along with.

## The cable

The X4 and the X4 Pro speak over the USB serial link that the log and the
web flasher use (115200 baud, no reset on opening: keep DTR and RTS low).
The device is not a USB drive. The cable transfer is in every firmware,
not only in test builds.

Requests and answers are lines of text. A line that does not begin with
`PPT/1 ` is not the transfer's: the device's log comes on the same link,
and a client passes over it.

The computer sends a request:

```
PPT/1 <n> <METHOD> <target> <body bytes>
PPT/1 <n> data <hex>
PPT/1 <n> data <hex>
```

`<n>` is the computer's own number for the request; the answer carries it.
The body follows as `data` lines of at most 512 bytes each, in
hexadecimal, until as many bytes came as the first line said. A request
without a body has `0` and no `data` lines.

The device answers:

```
PPT/1 <n> <status> <content type>
PPT/1 <n> data <hex>
PPT/1 <n> end
```

The body comes in `data` lines of at most 512 bytes. Answers are JSON
unless the status says otherwise. One request at a time may have a body
coming; send the next request once the answer to the last one came.

When the first request comes, the device opens its USB transfer screen.
It stays open while requests come, and closes after five minutes without
one, or when the reader presses *Back*.

## Requests

`GET /api/hello` needs no permission and says what the device is:

```json
{"protocol": 1, "device": "xteink-x4-pro", "name": "Xteink X4 Pro",
 "version": "0.4.0", "fingerprint": "bccc27c20e5fe947"}
```

`fingerprint` is the build that plugins with code must be made for, or
`null` where the device runs no plugins with code.

`GET /api/plugins` lists the plugins installed:

```json
{"plugins": [{"id": "airy", "version": "1.0.0", "on": true, "origin": "local"}]}
```

`origin` is `store` for a plugin the store installed (and updates),
`local` for one that came any other way, `built-in` for PaperPaw's own.

### Asking first

Before anything is written, the computer says what it means to send:

```
POST /api/offer
```

with a body of lines:

```
plugin my-plugin
plugin.ini 112
i18n/de.ini 40
code.ppn 20480
book Some book.epub 512000
```

`plugin <id>` names a plugin, and each line after it a file of it with
its size in bytes. `book <name> <size>` names a book (a file name without
folders). One plugin per offer; books as many as needed.

The device shows the names and sizes and asks the reader: *Allow this
computer to install a plugin / add books?* For a plugin with code it adds
that the code comes from this computer, not from the store, and runs with
full access to the device. The answer is *202* `{"state": "asking"}`;
*400* for an offer that names what may not be written (a path out of the
plugin's folder, a hidden file, a folder for a book); *507* where there is
not room for all of it.

The computer then asks `GET /api/offer` until the state is `allowed` or
`refused`. The permission holds for this offer, while the screen is open.

### Sending

Once allowed, only what was offered is taken, at the size offered, each
once:

- `PUT /api/plugin/<id>/<path>?sha256=<hex>`: a file of the plugin, its
  SHA-256 in hexadecimal. *422* where the file is not what was said.
- `POST /api/plugin/<id>`: installs the plugin from the files sent, in one
  step: `{"state": "installed", "restart": false}`. The version before
  stays until the new one is whole; the plugin's own data stays; it is
  loaded at once. A plugin with code is checked whole and must be built
  for the device's `fingerprint`; it runs after a restart (`"restart":
  true`). *422* `{"state": "refused", "why": …}` where it was not
  installed; nothing installed changed then.
- `PUT /api/book/<name>?sha256=<hex>`: a book, into the library folder,
  under a free name: never over a book there.
  `{"path": "books/Some book (2).epub"}`.

Requests that would write anything else are refused (*403*): no other
files, no settings, no reading of files.

## Over Wi-Fi

The Wi-Fi transfer page (*Tools*, *Wi-Fi transfer*) takes the same plugin
requests, each with the page's key (`k=`), shown on the device:

- `GET /api/plugins`
- `PUT /api/plugin/<id>/<path>?sha256=<hex>`
- `POST /api/plugin/<id>`: installs; for a plugin with code the device
  asks the reader first, and the answer is *202* `{"state": "asking"}`
- `GET /api/plugin/<id>`: how the last install stands (`none`, `asking`,
  `installed`, `refused`)
- `DELETE /api/plugin/<id>`: drops the files sent

## The emulator

`paperpaw-emu --stdio` speaks the cable transfer on standard input and
output, as a device does over its cable; in its window the questions show
and are answered as on a device. With `--headless` it answers what needs
no permission. For example:

```
python tools/usb-transfer.py --emulator "paperpaw-emu --stdio" install path/to/my-plugin
```
