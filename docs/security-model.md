# Security model

Who can do what with a device running PaperPaw, and what protects the
reader's books, settings and passwords. It is short on purpose: a map of
the boundaries, so that changes can be judged against it. Vulnerabilities
are reported as [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) says.

## What is protected

- **The firmware.** A device installs only firmware signed with
  PaperPaw's Ed25519 key, and it checks the signature while it writes
  the image. A new version that does not start cleanly is undone
  ([ADR 0019](adr/0019-firmware-updates.md)).
  The image paperpaw.org offers for flashing in the browser is signed
  too; the site and the browser check it before it is written.
  Firmware signed with another key (one's own builds) installs only
  when the reader accepts that key, shown by its fingerprint, at that
  install, and an older firmware only when the reader chooses it, told
  it is older: nothing on the card makes a key trusted.
- **Passwords and keys** (Wi-Fi, catalogs, sync accounts) are kept in
  `.paperpaw/secrets.txt`. They are veiled so that they do not show at a
  glance, but they are **not encrypted**: whoever has the card has them.
  On Android the file is in the app's private folder, which only
  PaperPaw reads. They are never shown
  in full; screens show dots and ask for them afresh. Wi-Fi networks the
  web flasher gives with the firmware (X4s) go to the card as `wifi.ini`,
  are kept with the passwords at the next start and the file removed;
  the flash keeps them only until the card has them.
- **Books and notes** are files on the card, as readable as the card is.

## Who can reach the device

- **Physical access (the card, USB).** Whoever holds the device can read
  and change the card and flash any firmware over USB (the chip's own
  bootloader); PaperPaw does not try to stop that. Firmware built for
  testing has a remote control over USB: files in and out, presses, the
  screen. Released firmware is built without it (the `remote` feature
  of `shells/xteink`).
- **The cable transfer.** Every firmware takes plugins and books from a
  computer over the USB cable ([docs/usb-transfer.md](usb-transfer.md)).
  It writes nothing before the reader allows it on the device: the
  device shows what is to come, with names and sizes. It takes only what
  it showed, each file by its size and SHA-256, and never writes over a
  book. An answer counts only for the offer shown, and *Back* ends the
  transfer. The Wi-Fi transfer installs plugins the same way.
- **The local network.** The device listens only while a screen that
  serves a page is open (the Wi-Fi transfer, typing on a phone, the
  flash cards' *Edit with your phone*, setting up Wi-Fi with a phone).
  Nothing listens in the background. The transfer, typing on a phone
  and the flash cards show an address as text and as a QR code. The
  address carries a key of 65 bits, drawn anew each time (`?k=`), and
  every request must carry it. After five wrong keys, no request is
  answered for a minute (`paperpaw_sdk::served`).
- **The reader's own network.** Where PaperPaw runs Wi-Fi itself, as on
  the X4s, two screens open a network of the device's own: the Wi-Fi
  transfer without a router and the setup of Wi-Fi with a phone. The
  network uses WPA2 with a password drawn anew each time. The password
  shows only on the screen, also as a QR code to join.
  The Wi-Fi setup serves its page only there and takes only the form it
  gave out. The network closes with the screen, or after ten minutes
  in which nothing comes.
- **The internet.** The device only connects out, for catalogs, sync,
  updates and news. Where the address says `https`, it uses TLS and
  checks the certificates against the clock, which it sets over the
  network first.
  An update search sends the chip, the version, the plugin crates built
  in, the fingerprint code plugins need and the code plugins installed
  with their versions, no identifier: when the
  reader asks, and once a day while an update found waits for plugins
  ([ADR 0022](adr/0022-plugins-in-updates.md)). The store asks for its
  list with the kind of device and the language, no identifier either.
- **Files.** Books, fonts, pictures and catalogs are untrusted input.
  The parsers bound their memory and time, and they reject what they
  cannot read. CI fuzzes six of them: EPUB, text, XML, hyphenation,
  images and Lua.

## Plugins

- **Code plugins** run as native code without a sandbox, with the
  kernel's rights. Through the SDK, a plugin reaches all of the card,
  the network and its own passwords and keys. Past the SDK, its code can
  reach everything, other plugins' passwords too. They are built into
  the firmware or the app. On the X4s they also come as plugin files
  (`code.ppn`, [ADR 0024](adr/0024-native-code-plugins.md)): from the
  store, with a firmware update, from the web flasher, or from a
  computer over the cable or the Wi-Fi transfer. A published file is
  signed by its author (Ed25519, `paperpaw-sign`); PaperPaw's own plugin
  files are signed with the project's plugin key. The store and a
  firmware update install a file only when it is made for this firmware
  and signed by the key the plugin library names for its author; the device remembers
  that key at the first install. In the store, an update signed by
  another waits until the reader, warned, installs it anyway; a firmware
  update does not fetch it at all. From the web flasher and from a
  computer the firmware also takes a file not signed (one's own build):
  from the flasher only for a plugin that has no author's key remembered
  yet, from a computer only once the reader said yes to its code on the
  device. Only code installed so runs: a file put into a plugin's folder
  by hand is not loaded. The list of code installed
  (`.paperpaw/plugin-code.txt`) is on the card, so whoever holds the card
  can change it, as test firmware does over USB; the transfers and
  plugins' own folders do not reach it. Code plugins are trusted as
  their author is.
- **Data plugins** (folders with `plugin.ini`) carry no code: translations,
  key maps, defaults of settings, presets, menus, actions made of steps,
  marks in the text, icons, steps of the first-run setup, lines for
  other plugins' points, fonts and stylesheets. They can change what
  PaperPaw shows and does through those, not reach past them, and never
  set a setting that keeps the device safe (such as the lock's).

## The screen lock

The lock is a PIN, a pattern or a password. It is asked for at start
and, unless the reader turns this off, on waking. It keeps a person who
picks up the device from using it: from reading what is open, changing
settings or seeing passwords on screen.
It is a convenience, not encryption: the card is as readable as without
it, and whoever takes the card out or flashes firmware gets past it. The
code is kept as a salted hash, never as it is.

Plugins are trusted (above), so the lock does not guard against them.
What the SDK makes sure, for plugins used honestly:

- **Codes are the lock's alone.** While the lock guards the device, what
  its screen or the keyboard it opened gives (the password typed) goes
  to the lock and that keyboard only: no other plugin's subscription,
  screen, bar or rule hears it. The kept code is a secret no other
  plugin is given.
- **Its settings are its own.** Settings marked guarded (the lock's kind
  and when it locks) are changed only by their plugin and the settings
  editor: not by presets, power modes, data plugins' defaults or other
  plugins' commands.
- **Nothing gets past it.** Screens opened while it guards go below it;
  the actions, notices and bars of other plugins wait; only the lock's
  own input filters see input. A screen of another plugin left above it
  (a sleep screen) gets no input and closes at the next input or as the
  device wakes, so the reader is never locked out.

The slots stay replaceable: a keyboard or a settings app put in place of
PaperPaw's is a trusted customisation and sees what the original would.

## What is not protected

- A lost or stolen device with its card: the passwords are only veiled.
- Firmware flashed over USB by someone holding the device.
- What a code plugin does with its rights, built in or installed.
