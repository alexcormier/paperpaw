# Files on the card

What PaperPaw keeps on a device's storage, and how each file stays
readable as PaperPaw changes. PaperPaw keeps its own files in
`.paperpaw`, named by `paperpaw_sdk::data::DIR`. Each plugin keeps its
files in `.paperpaw/plugins/<id>`, named by `Env::plugin_dir`. These are paths in the shell's storage: a shell may
keep the folder elsewhere than the books, e.g. in an app's own storage.
Every file is one of three kinds:

- **Data**: what the reader made or chose (settings, positions, notes,
  statistics). Every later version reads it. Its format has a version
  (`paperpaw_sdk::data::Format`): a text file says it in its first line,
  `# format 2`, and one without that line is version 1. A change that
  older readers would misread raises the version and adds the step from
  the version before; files are upgraded as they are read and written in
  the new format when they are saved next. Adding a key to an ini file
  needs no new version: readers skip keys they do not know. A version of
  PaperPaw older than a file (after going back to an older update) leaves
  the file as it is. Binary data files take a new name for a new version
  instead. Each version of each format has a file in a `testdata` folder
  that the tests read.
- **Cache**: made from the books or the network, made again when missing.
  Each carries a stamp of what it was made from and by which version of
  its maker; with another stamp it is made anew. Never upgraded.
- **Foreign**: formats of other programs (KOReader, Calibre), kept as
  those programs define them.

Reading positions and annotations are **locators** (ADR 0007). A
locator is a section, such as an EPUB's spine item, and an offset into
that section's source data. It does not point into the text a format
plugin made of it. So locators stay valid when a plugin converts books
differently; a plugin must keep that mapping.

## Data

| File | Owner | Format | Tested |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `paperpaw.ini` | kernel | ini: settings by plugin, `[plugins]` switched on or off, `[menus]`, `[keymap.*]`, `[fonts]`, `[slots]` | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/power.ini` | kernel | ini: the power mode worn (`mode`), whether *Automatic* chose it, the settings the reader took back from it (`released`) | |
| `.paperpaw/cleaned-up.txt` | kernel | when the storage was last cleaned up by itself, in seconds since 1970 | |
| `.paperpaw/secrets.txt` | kernel, SDK `secrets` | a line per password or key: id, label, flags, value veiled (tab separated) | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/library/books/<hash>.ini` | SDK `library` | ini: a book's details, cover, progress, fields of plugins (the details read again when their `version` is older) | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/library/opened.txt`, `favourites.txt` | SDK `library` | a path per line | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/readers/<hash>.txt`, `.paperpaw/readers-folders.txt` | SDK `readers` | the reading app chosen for a book; for folders a line each: reading app, folder (tab separated) | |
| `.paperpaw/annotations/<hash>.txt` | SDK `annotations` | a line per bookmark or highlight (tab separated; 8 fields before times were kept, 10 since). Version 2 (`# format 2`, written once any annotation says where it was made) has 13: after the times, the conversion its offsets are in (16 hex digits; `?` for one kept from before conversions, never moved) and its start and end as XPointers (empty where there are none), so it is found again in another conversion; one that cannot be found stays as it is. Before all of them are removed because KOReader's file has none any more (the reader agreed, asked in the book), the file is copied to `<hash>.txt.removed` (or `<hash>.txt (2).removed` and on) | versions 1 and 2 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/reader/state.ini` | reader | ini: the book read last | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/positions/<hash>.txt` | SDK `positions` | ini: where a book was left (`[position]` section, offset, percent, `conversion`, `xpointer` when it was closed, `updated`); one the reader cannot read is kept as `<hash>.txt.bad` (or `.bad2` and on) before a new one is written | |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/reader/books/<hash>/progress.ini` | reader | ini: the position before positions were shared; read while a book has none | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/reader/status-lines.txt` | reader | the status line chosen last at the top, then at the bottom, a line each | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/reader/books/<hash>/settings.ini` | kernel (a book's own settings) | ini, as `paperpaw.ini` | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/stats/books.ini` | stats | ini: a section per book (title, authors, md5, pages, language, series, `last-open`, path; `finished`, when it was last read to the end, added later) | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/stats/pages.bin` | stats | 16 bytes per stay on a page | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/stats/webdav.ini` | stats | ini of earlier versions: its password moves to the passwords and keys; the file goes at a later start, once the password is kept there | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/profiles/profiles.ini` | profiles | ini: a section per profile, its name and values | versions 1 and 2 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/profiles/last.txt` | profiles | the profile applied last | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/rules/rules.txt` | rules | a rule per line: trigger, effect, target, on, condition (tab separated) | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/vocabulary/words.txt` | vocabulary | a word per line: word, language, place, book, title, sentence (tab separated) | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/vocabulary/cards/decks.txt`, `deck-<id>.txt` | vocabulary | `paperpaw-decks 1` / `paperpaw-cards 1`, then a deck per line (id, name) or a card per line (id, due, last, stability, difficulty, reps, lapses, front, back, example; tab separated, texts escaped); and a line `next`, tab, the id the next deck or card gets (after the version line in `decks.txt`, after the cards in a deck), so no id is given twice. A file without it (from before) goes on after the highest id; the higher of the two counts. Older versions skip the line (a deck keeps it as it is), so the version stays 1 | |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/vocabulary/cards/answers.txt`, `due.txt`, `state.txt` | vocabulary | answers not yet written into their decks; when each deck's cards are due, by quarter hour; the time last known and the new cards shown that day | |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/vocabulary/cards/looked-up.txt`, `adding.txt`, `asleep.txt` | vocabulary | words looked up waiting to become cards (word, sentence); the deck cards are being added to; the card the sleep screen showed (deck, id) | |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/lock/tries.txt` | lock | the wrong tries in a row, a number | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/plugin-manager/screens.txt` | plugin-manager | the screens offered for a slot that were already asked about, `slot screen` a line | |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/store/queue.txt`, `queue-quiet.txt` | store | the plugins waiting to be installed, a line each, the one whose turn it is first (marked `> `, those of the setup `~`); what became of the setup's, `+<id>` or `-<id>` a line | |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/store/author.txt` | store | the key the plugin library names for the author of the code plugin being downloaded, until it is installed | |

| `.paperpaw/plugins/calibre/host.txt` | calibre | the address of the computer the reader chose to trust | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/opds/catalogs.txt` | opds | a catalog per line: name, address, user, (password, empty), folder, `sync`, `webdav` | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/opds/synced/<md5 of the address>.txt` | opds | the books a catalog's sync fetched, by their ids in the catalog, so that one deleted is not fetched again | |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/news/feeds.txt` | news | a feed per line: address, name | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/browser/bookmarks.txt`, `history.txt` | browser | a page per line: title, address | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/kosync/device.ini`, `account.ini` | kosync | ini: the device's id; the key of earlier versions (moved to the passwords and keys) | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/wallabag/articles.txt`, `finished.txt` | wallabag | an article per line: id and path; ids read to the end | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/wallabag/account.txt` | wallabag | the server and the user name the lists belong to, one a line: another account starts them anew | |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/joplin/sent.txt`, `sending.txt`, `waiting.txt`, `notebook.txt` | joplin | a book per line: notes file, note id, MD5 of the note's text (tab separated); the same for notes sent whose answer did not come; a notes file per line; the notebook's name and id | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/readwise/waiting.txt` | readwise | the notes files whose highlights wait to be sent, a path per line | |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/battery/log.csv` | battery | CSV with a header | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/crashes.txt` | X4 firmware | a line per panic: the version and why, written for bug reports, never read back | |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/battery/plugins.csv` | battery | CSV with a header, written for reading on a computer, never read back | |

| `.paperpaw/plugins/update/waiting.txt` | update | an update that waits for plugins: its version, `since <unix seconds or ->`, `checked <unix seconds or ->`, `asked`, `seen` and `told` lines where set, then what it waits for, `plugin <id> <version>` and `crate <name>` lines | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugin-authors.txt`, `plugin-code.txt` | SDK `native` | a code plugin per line: its id, a tab, its author's key remembered at the first install; its id, a tab, the SHA-256 of its file's header as installed (only such a file is loaded) | |
| `.paperpaw/plugin-origin.txt` | SDK `install` | the versions a store installed, a line each: a plugin's id, a tab, its version (the last four); a plugin counts as the store's, and gets its updates, only while its version is one of them | |
| `plugins/<id>/.install-marks` | SDK `install` | what an installer keeps for a plugin once it is in place (its code named as installed, its author, where it came from), handed over in the folder and kept by the kernel right after the install, or at the next start where that was cut short | |

| `.paperpaw/plugins/widgets/todo.txt` | widgets | an item per line, done ones as `x <date> <text>` (as todo.txt has them); an open item that would read as done (beginning with `x `) kept with the date `1970-01-01` in front, where todo.txt has the day an item was made | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/widgets/quotes.txt` | widgets | the reader's own quotes, a line each: `text \| author` | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/widgets/quote.txt`, `picture.txt` | widgets | the day and the turns of the quote and the picture shown | version 1 |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/widgets/seen.bits`, `newest.txt` | widgets | the books *Next up* saw, by the hashes of their paths, as a set of bits; the books that came since, a few | |
| `.paperpaw/plugins/widgets/reading.ini` | widgets | ini: the book read last, its page and pages, the seconds read and the pages turned for the speed; `chapter` and `chapter-left` (the pages left in it) added later | version 1 |

| `~<hash>.TMP`, `~<hash>.NEW` beside a file (the X4's card; seven letters from the file's name) | `paperpaw-fat` | a file while it is written: `.NEW` is whole and takes the file's place when its folder is first looked at after a start, unless the file was changed after `.NEW` was made (its time, size and first cluster then are kept in `.NEW`'s creation time); neither listed nor taken by name. `~PPMOVE.BIN` in the root (hidden, kept, not listed): the move being made, cleared after it, settled at the next start where it is not; where it cannot be, its two paths wait for the next start, all else goes on. Left by earlier versions, `~pp<n>.tmp`: removed at a write in their folder where empty or the same as a file beside them, else kept |

## A data plugin's files

A plugin without code is a folder, `plugins/<id>/`, with a `plugin.ini`
and the files below. The kernel reads them at the start
(`crates/paperpaw-core/src/data_plugin.rs`). Together they may take at
most 96 KiB, and the translations another 512 KiB. Each file may take
at most 64 KiB, and `plugin.ini` at most 4 KiB. The files of formats 3
may take at most 24 KiB of the 96 KiB, and `points/` holds at most 16
files. `paperpaw-dev check` says where a folder holds a file PaperPaw
does not read. Some files came with a later version of the data
formats: they are read only where `plugin.ini` says that version or a
later one (`formats = 3`), else left out, and PaperPaw says so.

### Which file for what

| To change | File | For example |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| any setting's default (sizes, fonts, the look, what a widget shows) | `settings.ini` | `[core]` `font-size = 14` |
| several settings chosen together (a power mode, a theme, a look of widgets) | `presets.ini` | `[night]` `kind = core.power-mode` |
| what buttons, taps and swipes do | `keymap.ini` | `[keymap.global]` `button.menu = core.refresh-screen` |
| an action of one's own, made of steps | `actions.ini` | `[night]` `run = core.night-mode=on` |
| what a menu holds, a menu of one's own | `menus.ini` | `[core.reader-menu]` `add = my.night after core.toc` |
| the icon of an action or a setting | `icons.ini` | `my.night = moon` |
| the words, or a whole new language | `i18n/<lang>.ini` | `[messages]` `my.night = Night reading` |
| fonts to read with, letters other fonts lack | `fonts/` (and `[extends]`, `[family]` in `plugin.ini`) | `fonts/Fredoka.ttf` |
| how books look | `styles.css` | `p { line-height: 1.6 }` |
| words marked on book pages | `marks.ini` | `[names]` `pattern = ...` |
| the home screen | `settings.ini` (`home.*`, see below) | `[home]` `page-1 = home.clock 0/0 4x1` |
| the logo (sleep screen, About, the logo widget) | a picture, named in `settings.ini` | `[core]` `logo = plugins/<id>/logo.png` |
| the sleep screen's pictures | a folder of pictures, named in `settings.ini` | `[sleep]` `show = sleep.show.picture`, `folder = plugins/<id>/sleep` |
| the pictures of the picture widget | a folder of pictures, named in `settings.ini` | `[widgets]` `picture.folder = plugins/<id>/pictures` |
| steps of the first-run setup | `setup.ini` | `[size]` `setting = core.font-size` |
| keyboard layouts, lines on *About* | `points/<point>.txt` | `points/keyboard.layouts.txt` |

There is no background picture for screens yet: no setting takes one,
so a plugin without code cannot set it.

| Path | Format | Read by, for | Since formats |
|------|--------|--------------|---------------|
| `plugin.ini` | ini: `[plugin]` with `id`, `name`, `description`, `version`, `formats`; `[extends]`, `[family]` and `[fonts]` (formats 3) where it brings fonts | the kernel: the plugin, its fonts, the fonts bound to roles | 1 |
| `i18n/<lang>.ini` | a translation catalog: `[meta]` (`language`, `name`, `plural`) and `[messages]` | the kernel: texts of any plugin, also a whole new language | 1 |
| `settings.ini` | ini: a section per plugin, a key per setting, as `paperpaw.ini` writes them | the kernel: new defaults for any plugin's settings (a theme, a home screen, a logo) | 1 |
| `keymap.ini` | ini: `[keymap.<layer>]` sections, `button.<name> = <action>` | the kernel: what buttons, taps and swipes do | 1 |
| `styles.css` | CSS | the reader: a stylesheet for books, after a book's own | 1 |
| `presets.ini` | ini: a section per preset, `kind`, `name`, `description`, then setting ids and values | the plugin that offers presets of that kind (power modes, themes, looks of widgets) | 1 |
| `fonts/*.ttf`, `.otf`, `.ttc` | font files, in `fonts/` or one folder below it | the kernel: fonts to read with, where scalable fonts are drawn | 1 |
| `fonts/*.ppfp` | font packs, named in `plugin.ini` (`[extends]`, `[family]`) | the kernel: letters other fonts lack, a family's faces, icons | 1 |
| pictures (`.png`, `.jpg`) | a file, or a folder of them, named in `settings.ini` (`logo = plugins/<id>/logo.png`) | the setting that names it: the logo, the sleep screen's pictures | 1 |
| `marks.ini` | ini: a section per role, `title`, one or more `pattern`, the look (`background`, `line`) | the reader: words marked on book pages | 2 |
| `menus.ini` | ini: a section per menu, `add = <entry> after <entry>`, `hide = <entry>`; a menu of one's own with `title` and `entries` | the kernel: entries of any menu | 3 |
| `actions.ini` | ini: a section per action, `title`, `icon`, `run` (steps, at most 16) | the kernel: actions made of steps | 3 |
| `icons.ini` | ini without sections: `<action or setting> = <icon name>` | the kernel: icons of actions and settings | 3 |
| `setup.ini` | ini: a section per step, `setting` or `screen`, `order`, `title`, `help` | the first-run setup: steps of its own | 3 |
| `points/<point>.txt` | text: a line each, `#` lines left out, at most 64 lines in all | the plugin that reads the point (`keyboard.layouts`, `about.lines`) | 3 |
| `how/<lang>.txt`, `*.md`, `*.txt` | text | people, and the plugin library (How it works); the kernel does not read them | |

A short example of each that a plugin of a few lines might ship:

```ini
# plugin.ini
[plugin]
id = night-reader
name = Night reader
description = Reading in the dark, one tap away.
version = 1.0.0
# The version of the data formats the files are written in: 1 for
# settings, presets, key maps, translations, fonts, styles and pictures;
# 2 where there is a marks.ini; 3 where there is a menus.ini,
# actions.ini, icons.ini, setup.ini, points/ or [fonts] here.
formats = 3

# settings.ini
[core]
font-size = 14

# keymap.ini
[keymap.global]
button.menu = night-reader.night

# presets.ini
[night]
kind = core.power-mode
name = Night
power.level = offline

# marks.ini
[names]
title = Names
pattern = \b(?:Mr|Mrs|Miss)\. [A-Z]\w+
background = yellow

# actions.ini
[night]
title = Night reading
icon = moon
run = core.night-mode=on, core.font-size=14, notify:Good night

# menus.ini
[core.reader-menu]
add = night-reader.night after core.toc

# icons.ini
night-reader.night = moon

# setup.ini
[size]
setting = core.font-size
order = 35
```

```text
# points/about.lines.txt
Night reader is made by Ada.
```

### settings.ini

A setting's id is its plugin, a dot and the rest: in `settings.ini` the
plugin is the section and the rest is the key, so `core.font-size` is
`font-size` in `[core]`, and `widgets.picture.folder` is
`picture.folder` in `[widgets]`. The values are written as
`paperpaw.ini` writes them:

- a switch: `true` or `false` (also `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`, `1`, `0`);
- a number: a whole number within the setting's range. The settings
  list shows the range, and `paperpaw-emu --registry registry.json`
  writes it as `min` and `max`;
- a choice: the whole id of the option, as `files.view.covers`, not
  `covers`;
- a list: ids separated by commas;
- a text, a folder or a file: as it is, a path from the top of the card
  (`plugins/<id>/...`).

A value PaperPaw does not take (a number out of its range, a choice
that is no option, a setting no plugin has) is not taken, and PaperPaw
says why; it is not made to fit. A default that keeps the device safe
(the lock's) is taken only from its own plugin.

These are defaults, nothing more: what the person chose themselves (in
the settings, kept in `paperpaw.ini`) stays, whichever plugin brings
another default, and switching the plugin off in the plugin manager
brings the defaults back as they were without it, after the restart.

### actions.ini

An action runs at most 16 steps in order, separated by commas. A step
is one of these: a setting and a value, as `core.night-mode=on`;
`open:<slot>`; `notify:<text>`; `emit:<event>`, with an event of the
plugin's own named `<plugin>.<name>`; or the id of another action that
is not in the same file. A step setting a value of the wrong kind is passed over, and one
setting what keeps the device safe is never done. An action of more
than 16 steps, or one that runs an action of its own file, is no
mistake PaperPaw passes over: the file is refused, and the plugin with
it, which the plugin manager then shows as *Error*. `paperpaw-dev check`
finds this before, as `package.actions`. It also finds a default in
`settings.ini` that PaperPaw would not take, as `package.settings`.

### A home screen without code

The home screen keeps its pages in settings (`plugins/home/src/pages.rs`).
So a `settings.ini` can bring a home screen of its own as new defaults:
the pages `home.page-1` to `home.page-8` and the grid they are laid on.
The first page always shows; the others show where they hold
something. Each page is a list
of items, separated by commas: a widget's id, or `tool:` and an action's
id, then its column and row and its size in cells (`<column>/<row>
<width>x<height>`, counted from 0). An item without a place goes into
the first free cells, as wide as the grid.

```ini
# settings.ini
[home]
columns = 4
rows = 0
status-bar = true
page-1 = home.clock 0/0 4x1, home.continue 0/1 4x2, tool:core.library 0/3 2x1, tool:store.open 2/3 2x1
page-2 = home.tools
footer.dots = true
footer.pencil = true
```

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| `home.page-1` to `home.page-8` | a page's items, as above |
| `home.columns` | columns of the grid, 2 to 6 |
| `home.rows` | rows, at most 12; 0 makes cells about as high as wide |
| `home.status-bar` | whether the status line shows above the grid |
| `home.footer.dots`, `home.footer.pencil` | the page dots and the pencil that edits the page, below it |
| `home.footer.items` | status items of any plugin below the page, their ids separated by commas |

The widgets, their ids and the actions a tool can run are those that
`paperpaw-emu --registry registry.json` lists under `widgets` and
`actions`. The home screen's own widgets are `home.clock`, `home.date`,
`home.status`, `home.continue`, `home.recent` and `home.tools`.
`home.tools` shows every tool not placed otherwise, a cell each. Defaults change only what the reader has not
chosen: a reader who arranged the home screen by hand keeps that.

A widget's own settings take defaults the same way, by the setting's
id: `home.clock.date` (whether the clock shows the date) is `clock.date`
in `[home]`, `widgets.picture.folder` is `picture.folder` in
`[widgets]`. Such a default holds for every place of the widget that
has no value of its own. A widget placed twice has its second place
named with `@2`, as `widgets.clock@2` on the page. That place has
settings of its own, such as `widgets.clock@2.face`, and those take no
default from a plugin.

| Files | Owner | Defined by |

| `.paperpaw/plugins/stats/statistics.sqlite3` and the files of a sync | stats | KOReader's statistics |
| `<book>.sdr/metadata.<ext>.lua` | koreader | KOReader's book settings |
| `<book>.sdr/<book file>.annotations.lua` | koreader | KOReader, which takes the annotations over and removes the file |
| `wifi.ini` (at the top of the card) | wifi | networks to join, `ssid = ...` and `password = ...` lines. The firmware writes them there at a start from what the web flasher gave, or the reader writes them by hand. At a start they are kept with the passwords and keys, and the file is removed. |
