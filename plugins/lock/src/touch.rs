//! The touch lock: while it is on, taps, swipes and the pen do nothing,
//! so that a hand resting on the screen turns no page; the buttons go on
//! working. Off by default.
//!
//! - One switch, `lock.touch`, in the quick panel and the reader's menu
//!   (and Settings › Controls), on touch screens only; *Lock touch*
//!   (`lock.touch-toggle`) switches it from any button or rule.
//! - An input filter takes every finger and pen before screens, gestures
//!   and key maps see it, on every screen; not while the screen lock asks
//!   for its code.
//! - A way out that needs no menu and that a resting hand does not make
//!   (`Escape`): one finger taps twice and stays down on the second tap
//!   (a third touch held after two taps counts too); or, where
//!   PaperPaw is the firmware, the power button held, or the home key (the
//!   X4 Pro's, below the screen) held. A small lock in the status lines
//!   says it is on. Its times allow for a slow screen: a refresh may hold
//!   the touches back that came meanwhile.
//! - Said whenever it turns on or off, however it was switched (the
//!   setting's change); and while it is on, a touch that is no step of
//!   the way out says again how to unlock, at most every [`HINT_MS`], as
//!   a notice (no full refresh): never in the middle of the way out, whose
//!   taps a refresh would hold back.
