//! Reading progress synced with KOReader's sync server ("kosync"), so a
//! book opens where one stopped on another device, PaperPaw or KOReader.
//!
//! - Books are identified as KOReader does (a partial MD5 of the file), so
//!   the same file matches on every device.
//! - Positions are KOReader's XPointers where the format has them (EPUB),
//!   besides the percentage.
//! - The progress is sent at most once a minute while reading (where
//!   PaperPaw runs the radio itself, only while it is on anyway: turning
//!   pages never keeps it on), and when a book is closed and the device
//!   sleeps or the app goes to the background; it is fetched when a book
//!   opens and when the app comes back. If another device is further, a dialog offers to
//!   go there (once for each position).
//! - Nothing is sent for a book while its progress is being fetched, nor
//!   while the dialog is open or was left without a choice (offered
//!   again when the server's position moves), nor before the server's
//!   progress was read (a failed fetch is tried again first): a further
//!   position on the server is never overwritten before the user chose
//!   to stay.
//! - *Sync progress* in the reading menu's *More* fetches the latest, then
//!   sends this device's position unless another device is further.
//! - The account (settings → *Progress sync*) keeps the user name in the
//!   settings and only the MD5 of the password, as KOReader does. Its
//!   screen also sets the server: KOReader's or any compatible one, also
//!   below a path (`https://example.org/kosync`) or over plain `http` in a
//!   home network. Another server signs out, however it was set: an
//!   account's key belongs to its server.
//!
//! Needs a device with network ([`Capabilities::network`](paperpaw_sdk::Capabilities)).

// What goes wrong with the user's data is told, never dropped unseen:
// a result left unread says why (see CONTRIBUTING.md).
