//! Flash cards: decks of cards, each with a front, a back and an example,
//! and what FSRS knows of it (see [`fsrs`](crate::fsrs)).
//!
//! Kept in the plugin's folder, `cards/`, as text, a line each with tabs
//! between the fields (a tab, a line break or a backslash in a text
//! written `\t`, `\n`, `\\`), the version on the first line:
//!
//! - `decks.txt`: `paperpaw-decks 1`, then `id<TAB>name` for each deck;
//! - `deck-<id>.txt`: `paperpaw-cards 1`, then a card a line,
//!   `id<TAB>due<TAB>last<TAB>stability<TAB>difficulty<TAB>reps<TAB>lapses<TAB>front<TAB>back<TAB>example`:
//!   `due` and `last` in seconds since 1970 (0 for a new card, never
//!   seen), stability (in days) and difficulty in hundredths;
//! - `answers.txt`: the answers given since the decks were last written,
//!   `deck<TAB>` a card's fields up to `lapses`, then the due time it had
//!   before. Appended at each answer, so a review writes little; folded
//!   into the decks ([`fold`]) when a review ends, at a start, and before
//!   a deck is changed otherwise;
//! - `due.txt`: `paperpaw-due 1`, then `deck<TAB>new cards<TAB>quarter=count …`
//!   for each deck, the quarter hours (since 1970) its other cards are due
//!   in: what the widget counts without reading the decks (every time
//!   zone's day begins on a quarter hour, so the count is exact);
//! - `looked-up.txt`: words looked up, `word<TAB>sentence`, waiting to
//!   become cards of the deck *Looked up* when the flash cards open next
//!   (a lookup only appends a line);
//! - `adding.txt`: the deck cards are being added to, while they are: an
//!   addition cut off is counted into the index again at the next start;
//! - `state.txt`: `clock <seconds>`, the time last known (for a device
//!   that does not know it now), and `new <day> <count>`, the new cards
//!   shown that day.
//!
//! A deck is only ever streamed, a line at a time. One written anew goes
//! beside itself (`deck-<id>.tmp`) and takes its place once whole, as do
//! the lists, so a failed write or a power cut never loses cards; lines a
//! deck holds that are no card are kept as they are. A review holds the
//! due cards' state and where their lines are, never their texts but the
//! one shown.
