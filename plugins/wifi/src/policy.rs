//!
//! - The radio comes on when a plugin wants the network and the user
//!   lets it ([`ON_DEMAND`](crate::ON_DEMAND)); then the strongest secured
//!   network joined before is joined, the next one if that fails (open
//!   networks only when chosen, see [`best_known`]).
//! - A scan that finds no network joined before is made again, up to
//!   [`SCANS`] times, before none counts as in reach.
//! - A round that joins nothing is tried again a little later while the
//!   network is still wanted or charging keeps the radio on (e.g. while a
//!   router starts, or once a first try had no answer). The network is
//!   wanted for as long as what waits for it does: up to
//!   [`NETWORK_WAIT_MS`] after it was asked for, and not after the plugin
//!   said none is coming (`Command::NoNetwork`), whatever the kernel's
//!   flag says.
//! - It goes off a while after nothing uses the network
//!   ([`IDLE_OFF`](crate::IDLE_OFF)), unless the user switched it on on
//!   the page (it stays on until switched off there) or it stays on
//!   while charging ([`WHILE_CHARGING`](crate::WHILE_CHARGING)).
