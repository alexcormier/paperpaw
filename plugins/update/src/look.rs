//! Looking for updates by itself (the setting [`LOOK`], off unless the
//! reader turns it on, in the first-run setup or the settings): about
//! once a week the update server is asked, as the page asks it, but only
//! at a cheap moment, when the radio is on anyway or the device charges
//! (declared work, ADR 0025: optional, without a deadline, so it never
//! switches the radio on by itself on the battery). What it finds waits
//! quietly where the reader looks: the update page, and a badge on its
//! entry in the settings; nothing is said over reading.
