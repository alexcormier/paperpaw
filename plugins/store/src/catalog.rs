//! The plugin library's list and its plugins (ADR 0023, format 2), read
//! as they stream from the files they were saved to.
//!
//! The list (`plugins.json?device=x4&lang=de`) holds only the plugins for
//! this device, in the order to show them (by group, then by name in the
//! language asked for), without their files:
//!
//! ```json
//! {"format": 2, "plugins": [{
//!   "id": "airy-theme", "name": "Luftig", "summary": "…", "group": "look",
//!   "author": "…", "licence": "Apache-2.0", "kind": "data",
//!   "latest": {"version": "1.0.0", "sdk": "0.4", "formats": 1, "size": 2345}}]}
//! ```
//!
//! A code plugin is `"kind": "code"`, with `latest.builds` (each a
//! `device`, the `abi` it was built for, `url`, `size`, `sha256`) and the
//! `author_key` its author signs with; it is listed where a build fits
//! this device and PaperPaw.
//!
//! `"official": true` marks PaperPaw's own plugins. It is taken only from
//! PaperPaw's own library ([`OFFICIAL_LIST`], over HTTPS), and for a code
//! plugin only where its `author_key` is PaperPaw's ([`FIRST_PARTY_KEY`]):
//! a list made elsewhere cannot give the mark, whatever it says.
//!
//! The plugins that fit go to an index on the storage: a line each, and
//! where each line begins (4 bytes each). In memory are only the runs of
//! plugins of one group, so the list may grow without limit. A plugin's
//! page asks for it with its files (`plugins/<id>.json`, the same fields
//! and `latest.files`, with the list's own query), read when it comes.
//!
//! A plugin of the library is passed over where the device has a plugin
//! of that id it cannot take the place of ([`may_install`]): one built
//! in, or one of the other kind.
