//! Converts an XHTML chapter into PaperPaw's compact block format while it
//! is inflated, and stores the result in the plugin's cache:
//!
//! - `<n>.txt`: records of an 8-byte header (kind, heading level, flags,
//!   alignment, text length and number of style runs as u16), the block's
//!   UTF-8 text and its style runs (start, end and style as u16).
//! - `<n>.idx`: for every record, the offset of its text as u32 (for
//!   binary search), the book's indent as i16 and the book's space above
//!   as u16, in hundredths of an em ([`NO_INDENT`] and [`NO_SPACE`] if it
//!   sets none), its text size as u16 in percent of body text (0 if it
//!   sets none), its margins at the start and the end of the lines as u16
//!   each, in hundredths of an em, and its distance between lines as u16
//!   in percent of its text size (0 if it sets none). Kept apart from the
//!   text so positions in it stay the same when more is stored per
//!   block.
//! - `<n>.anc`: `id<TAB>offset` lines for anchors (table of contents).
//! - `<n>.lnk`: `start<TAB>end<TAB>href` lines for links, in order: `href`
//!   as an archive path with its fragment (`text/ch2.xhtml#note3`), or as
//!   written for links out of the book.
//! - `<n>.pos`: `offset<TAB>path` lines: the element each record comes
//!   from, as a path below `<body>` such as `div[2]/p[22]`, for positions
//!   other readers understand (KOReader's XPointers).
//! - `<n>.xpt`: `offset<TAB>node<TAB>char` lines: where the text of each
//!   text node of the chapter begins in `<n>.txt` (and goes on, where
//!   what PaperPaw shows leaves out characters the node has), as the node
//!   below `<body>` such as `div[2]/p[22]/em[1]/text()[1]` and the
//!   character in it, for exact positions in KOReader's XPointers. Nodes
//!   and characters are counted as KOReader's engine (crengine) keeps
//!   them: white space folded into one space, white space alone at the
//!   start of a block dropped.
//! - `<n>.end`: the length of `<n>.txt` as u32. Written last, so its
//!   presence marks a complete conversion.
//!
//! All files are appended in small pieces while converting, and positions
//! in a chapter are offsets into `<n>.txt`, so neither converting nor
//! reading ever holds more than a block in memory. The pictures of a
//! chapter are listed in `<n>.pic` while it is read and taken in after
//! it, so they do not take memory either. What is kept per open element
//! is bounded, and elements nested deeper than [`MAX_DEPTH`] are read as
//! part of the deepest one, so no markup, however deep, exhausts memory;
//! what is written for a chapter is bounded by its size (see
//! [`budget`]).
//!
//! HTML files (e.g. web pages) are converted the same way, read as
//! browsers do (see [`Source::Html`]), and FictionBooks, their elements
//! read as the HTML ones they look like (see [`Source::Fb2`]).
