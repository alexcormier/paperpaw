//! Reading goal: the daily goal of the reading statistics (`stats.goal`,
//! 20 minutes at first where this plugin is), and a cat whose mood follows
//! how much of it was read today:
//! sad while nothing was, meh after a little, content from half the goal
//! (`reading-goal.content`, in percent), happy once it is reached
//! (`reading-goal.happy`).
//!
//! - *Reading cat* (`reading-goal.widget`), a widget for the home screen
//!   and the sleep screen's widgets: the cat of today's mood, as large as
//!   its place leaves, and below it the minutes read and the goal (part
//!   `minutes`). A tap opens the goal's setting; where the statistics are
//!   off it offers to switch them on, where they are missing to get them
//!   from the store.
//! - A sleep screen of its own (*Today's reading cat* among the sleep
//!   screen's choices): the cat large in the middle, the minutes and the
//!   goal below it.
//!
//! The pictures are PaperPaw's cats (see `NOTICE`), or one's own: the
//! folder `reading-goal.pictures` names holds `sad`, `meh`, `content` and
//! `happy` (`.png`, `.jpg`), any size; those missing are the cats'. A data
//! plugin brings a set of its own as such a folder and names it in its
//! `settings.ini` (`[reading-goal] pictures = plugins/<id>/cats`).
//!
//! Today's reading comes from the reading statistics (the `stats`
//! plugin), which tell it as they record it ([`events::READ_TODAY`]);
//! it is kept in `today.txt` (`<day> <seconds>`, version 1). Without
//! them, nothing is counted, and the widget says so. Without a goal (set
//! to none), the cat goes by [`DEFAULT_GOAL`] minutes and only the
//! minutes read show.
