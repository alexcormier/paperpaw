//! Merging statistics with KOReader's, as KOReader's own sync does
//! (`ReaderStatistics.onSync`), except for what this device lost:
//!
//! - Books are the same when their file is (the partial MD5; for a book
//!   KOReader knows no file of, KOReader's key of title, authors and
//!   MD5). Their title and authors are taken from KOReader, so KOReader
//!   recognises them by its key (title, authors, MD5) when it merges the
//!   file back.
//! - What the last uploaded file (`cached`) has but the other side no
//!   longer has was deleted there: it goes here too. Books and single
//!   stays alike; but a book deleted there keeps the stays read here
//!   since the last upload, and so stays.
//! - Where the other side's file lacks too much of the last upload (all
//!   its books, or more than half of its stays), it is told apart what
//!   happened. Whole books gone, the others' stays there, and a stay of
//!   a book gone older than one there: they were deleted there. All that
//!   is lacking newer than all there, and a book there cut short: a
//!   backup was restored there. A file of another version is replaced
//!   too. What was replaced counts as not deleted there
//!   ([`Outcome::kept`]). Where it cannot be told (an empty file: all
//!   statistics reset there, or another device's file), nothing counts
//!   as deleted there until the user decides ([`Outcome::unclear`]).
//! - What the last upload has but this device no longer has is not taken
//!   for deleted here, as KOReader would take it: PaperPaw deletes no
//!   statistics, so it was lost, and comes back from the other side.
//! - The same stay (book, page, start) on both sides keeps the longer
//!   duration.
//!
//! - Stays of a book whose entry was lost here are kept, and books added
//!   take ids above theirs; they are not uploaded.
//!
//! Nothing is merged from what cannot be read whole: an unreadable file
//! of the other side (also one without a column needed), `books.ini` or
//! log ends the merge with an error before anything here is written. A
//! last upload that cannot be read is left out: then nothing counts as
//! deleted there.
//!
//! Everything goes through files sorted in small runs ([`extsort`]), so
//! memory stays small whatever the number of stays.
