//! Built-in device profiles.
//!
//! A profile describes everything the emulator needs to behave like a
//! device: screen, pixel format, input hardware, buttons and the heap the
//! kernel may use. The Xteink profiles build the kernel as the firmware
//! does (`shells/xteink/src/main.rs`), the Boox Go 7 as the Android shell
//! does (`shells/android/src/app.rs`); a change there belongs here too.
//! The emulator keeps the kernel's own clipboard on every profile.
