//! The emulator as a library: the emulated device, its profiles and what
//! measures it (heap budget, storage trace), for the `paperpaw-emu`
//! window and for tools that drive the device themselves, such as
//! `paperpaw-dev` (`tools/dev`) and the browser's emulator
//! (`shells/web`). Without the feature `window` it has no window and
//! builds for `wasm32` too.
//!
//! Linking it puts its allocator in charge ([`budget::BudgetAllocator`]),
//! so that the kernel's heap is counted against the device's budget.
