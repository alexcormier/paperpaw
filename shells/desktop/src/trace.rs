//! What the storage is asked frame by frame (`--trace`), below the kernel
//! as the X4's `trace` sees the card: the calls each frame's drawing made,
//! band by band, how long the drawing took, and the calls made since the
//! frame before (opening a screen, handling a press). Drawn in bands, a
//! screen that reads while it draws reads again in every band.
//!
//! The times are the computer's, many times faster than an X4's; the
//! calls are the same on both.
