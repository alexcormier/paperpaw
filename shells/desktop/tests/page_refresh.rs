//! A page turned in a book refreshes partially on the X4s, by a button
//! or a tap: no full refresh, and no frame in grays (which a panel of
//! black and white shows with a refresh of the whole screen). Full
//! refreshes come only every few pages, as *Full refresh* says. An X4 Pro
//! flashed at every page in beta.8's tests, with smooth text on.
