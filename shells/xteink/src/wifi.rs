//! The radio, as the kernel tells it (`paperpaw_sdk::wifi`): on and off,
//! looking for networks, joining and leaving one, and what happened. When
//! and which network is the `wifi` plugin's to decide; this only does it.
//!
//! esp-radio (Espressif's radio firmware with a Rust driver around it,
//! whose interface is still a beta before its 1.0) is used here alone, so a
//! change of it changes this file. It needs a scheduler that switches
//! tasks (esp-rtos), started the first time the radio is and running on
//! (idle) after. Off, the driver is dropped: the radio is powered down and
//! its memory (about 47 KB) free again.
//!
//! Looking for networks and joining one take a while: they go on in the
//! background, moved on by [`Radio::poll`] from the main loop, so the X4
//! stays usable.
//!
//! For the setup with a phone it opens a network of its own (an access
//! point, `WifiCommand::Host`) at [`HOST_ADDRESS`]; any other command
//! closes it again, the radio back in a station's part.
