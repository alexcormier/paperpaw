//! The time of day: set over the network (SNTP, by `network` once the

//! runs through light sleep. The X4 has no clock that runs while it is
//! off: its time is gone then, until the network sets it again. The X4
//! Pro's clock chip keeps it: read at start (`main`), and set whenever the
//! network sets the time (`input::keep_time`).
//!
//! The SNTP messages are `quireink_x4::sntp`.
