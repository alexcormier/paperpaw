//! The web flasher's bundle of plugins (`paperpaw_native::bundle`), found
//! at the firmware's first start at the start of the other app partition
//! (the flasher puts it there for firmware that says it looks there,
//! [`OTHER_SLOT`]: room for the whole store), or behind the firmware's
//! image (where it put it before). Its plugins are copied
//! onto the card into folders PaperPaw does not load (`plugins/.<id>.part`),
//! each file checked by its SHA-256 as it is copied and a plugin's code by
//! its author's signature, for the kernel to install before it loads
//! plugins (`KernelBuilder::install_plugin`), so they run at this start.
//! Its origin, author's key and code digest are staged with the files
//! (`install::marks`) and kept only once installed; code signed by another
//! author than the version installed before is not installed, and the plugin manager says
//! so (`Native::not_installed`): the reader decides in the store, warned.
//! Behind the image, the bundle's first sector is erased once they are
//! all on the card (on the X4 its code plugins go there, and are placed
//! as the kernel installs them). In the other app partition it is erased
//! only once the kernel installed them ([`forget`], `main`): a power cut
//! before that, while copying or installing, leaves it as it was, and the
//! next start copies and installs it again, each plugin in place of what
//! it left; never half of one. Without a card it waits; an update, which
//! goes into that partition, needs the card and comes from the kernel,
//! so only after it was installed. A partition that holds no bundle (an
//! image, another firmware's, CrossPoint's) is never written.
//!
//! A bundle for another image, or one that is damaged, is erased without
//! installing anything; one that cannot be copied (no card, a card full)
//! waits for the next start. On the X4 the bundle lies where its code
//! plugins go: they get room once it is installed.
