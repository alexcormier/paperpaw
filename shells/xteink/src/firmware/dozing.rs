//! Staying awake on USB, the developer's choice (#96): the main loop's side
//! of [`paperpaw_x4::stay_awake`]. While it is on and the cable is in, the
//! kernel does not sleep by itself, and a sleep the reader asks for is a
//! doze: the sleep picture stays, plugins heard `core.suspend`, and the X4
//! reads USB and the buttons awake, so the computer keeps it. The first
//! press or command wakes it (`core.resume`); a cable pulled meanwhile puts
//! it to sleep for real, two seconds after (the choice never leaves a
//! forgotten X4 awake on its battery).
