//! The card taken out and put back while PaperPaw runs (#145): the shell's
//! part of `paperpaw_fat::CardSwap`. A card found lost (reads and writes
//! failing, or the look at it after a pause or on waking) is started
//! again and mounted anew, never written with what was kept of it; the
//! kernel then walks the library again, as after a USB drive.
