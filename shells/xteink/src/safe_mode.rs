//! Safe mode (ADR 0024): starts that load code plugins and never reach

//! panic, a watchdog); after [`FAILED_STARTS`] of them PaperPaw starts
//! without code plugins, and so it does when the reader holds *Back* (the
//! X4, the X4 Classic) or *Home* (the X4 Pro) at power-on. The kernel then switches off
//! the plugin the last crash was in, or every code plugin when that is not
//! known, and the plugin manager says so ([`paperpaw_sdk::native::SafeMode`]).
//!
//! What is kept: how many starts failed, the code plugin loaded last, and
//! the one a panic's calls were in (`crash` finds it). Cutting the power
//! clears it all, as a start after that is a new one.
