//! Outer power. The X4 has a pin that is high while a cable is in; the
//! ESP32-S3's X4 Pro and X4 Classic (USB through pogo pins) have a pin that
//! is high while a cable charges the cell (measured on the Pro, #209; it may
//! mean "power present", which the pin alone does not tell from "charging"); the X3 has only its fuel gauge. Two different
//! things are asked (#209):
//!
//! - **charging**: the device is on outer power and the cell takes it: the
//!   charging pin (the X3: its fuel gauge, or a computer's USB frames, as
//!   before). It is what the status bar's bolt shows, what the kernel's
//!   low-battery rules and its install check take for "charging", and what a
//!   sleeping reader's switch-off waits for. A computer that merely talks
//!   over the cable, with a full cell, is not charging.
//! - **cable**: a cable seems to be in (charging, or a computer sends USB
//!   frames, or the device has just started): it keeps an awake reader from
//!   napping, because a light sleep cuts the link to the computer, and it
//!   keeps a reader that was told to stay awake on USB awake.
//!
//! [`Sense`] says both for every device; [`UsbPower`] is the S3's and the
//! X3's.
