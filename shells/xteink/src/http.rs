//! Plugins' HTTP requests (the kernel's `HttpCall`s), made over the
//! network of `net` without stopping the X4: each one moves on a step at a
//! time from the main loop (finding the host, connecting, sending,
//! receiving), the protocol by `paperpaw_http`. A body meant for a file
//! goes there as it comes (by way of a `.part` file, renamed once whole),
//! so a large download never needs to fit in memory; an error's body is
//! kept apart, never written over the file. Redirects are followed as
//! `paperpaw_http::follow` says: never down to plain `http`, never with
//! credentials to another server.
//!
//! `https://` goes over TLS (`tls`), with the certificate checked; one
//! such connection at a time, for its memory.
