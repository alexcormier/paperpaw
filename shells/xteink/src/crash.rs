//! What happens when the firmware panics: it says why in its log, keeps
//! the message through the reset (for `boot` over USB: the log may not
//! reach the computer, e.g. when the radio took the USB link along) and
//! starts the X4 again, where halting would leave it on with nothing to
//! be done until a watchdog came. Started again, it writes the message to
//! the card ([`keep`]), for bug reports.
//!
//! The message ends with where the code was, `@` and the addresses of the
//! calls that led there, innermost first (the firmware is built with frame
//! pointers): `tools/x4-remote.py --crashes` names their functions from
//! the firmware's symbols. An allocation that failed says so this way
//! too, with the code that asked for it. A call in a native plugin's code
//! is followed by the plugin and the offset into its file, e.g.
//! `4280a1c4 (hello+0x7f30)`, and safe mode learns the plugin
//! (`safe_mode::crashed_in`).
