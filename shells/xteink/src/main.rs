//! PaperPaw on the Xteink X4 (ESP32-C3), the X4 Pro (ESP32-S3, with a
//! touch screen) and the X4 Classic (ESP32-S3, the X4's buttons): the
//! kernel with the standard app, its screen, buttons, battery and SD card.
//! The feature `x4`, `x4-pro`, `x4-classic` or `x3` says which.
//!
//! - **Board**: which pin does what, in one place (`board`, for the X4 Pro
//!   `board_pro`, for the X4 Classic `board_classic`; the card of both
//!   `card_pro`).
//! - **Screen**: the kernel draws in bands of [`FRAME_ROWS`] rows; each
//!   goes straight into the display controller's memory, which keeps the
//!   frame (see `paperpaw_x4::display`).
//! - **Buttons**: read in a timer's interrupt and debounced, so presses
//!   count while PaperPaw is busy (`input`, `paperpaw_x4::buttons`).
//! - **Storage**: the SD card's FAT file system, with long file names
//!   (`paperpaw_fat`). Without a card, PaperPaw starts with nothing to
//!   read.
//! - **Sleep**: the sleep screen stays shown; the battery's power is cut,
//!   and the power button starts the X4 again, where it was.
//! - **Main loop**: `firmware`; remote control over USB for testing
//!   (`remote`) with the `remote` feature, on by default.
