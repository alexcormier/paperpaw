//! Bluetooth Low Energy on the X4 Pro (feature `bluetooth`, ADR 0027):
//! what the kernel asks of the radio (`Io::Bluetooth`), done with
//! trouble-host, Embassy's host stack, on esp-radio's controller.
//!
//! The controller is up only while the kernel wants the radio: its
//! 35 KB of internal RAM come back when it goes down. While up, one
//! future holds everything (the controller, the host and its resources,
//! scanning, each link), polled from the main loop as the Wi-Fi tasks
//! are; it talks to the main loop through [`Shared`]. A link is a slot
//! of its own ([`LINKS`] of them, the kernel's `max_links`): connecting,
//! its GATT client, pairing and the HID reports of a remote.
//!
//! Switched off it costs no heap: the host, its resources, its packets
//! and what the main loop shares with it are made when the radio comes
//! up and dropped when it goes down. What stays is code and some 0.5 KB
//! of the controller's statics.
//!
//! Advertising and the GATT server come with step 4 of the ADR: until
//! then advertising ends at once and the server's calls are dropped.
