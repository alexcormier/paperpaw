//! No screen of the standard app reads the storage while it draws.
//! The X4 draws a frame in bands, a screen's `draw`
//! once for each, so what `draw` reads is read again for every band: the
//! home screen once took 1.9 s to draw instead of 0.33 s for it. Each
//! screen is opened here as on an X4 on which a book was read, and what
//! drawing it does on the card is noted band by band, below the kernel as
//! the X4's `trace` sees it: nothing after the first band of the frame it
//! comes up with, and nothing at all when it is drawn again. A screen
//! loads what it shows when it opens or that changes, and keeps it.
//!
//! The one thing read while drawing is the rows of pictures too large to
//! keep (`ui::draw_image` reads those a band at a time, the X4 having no
//! memory for a frame or such a picture), each row once a frame. Which
//! pictures are small enough to keep (`ui::Thumbnail`) this cannot tell,
//! as it does not see how large they are drawn.
