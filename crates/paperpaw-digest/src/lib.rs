//! Digests PaperPaw needs to work with other programs and to name files:
//! [`md5`] (KOReader's fingerprint of a book file, its sync keys),
//! [`sha1`] (Calibre's and others' needs), [`sha256`] (that files came
//! whole, e.g. native plugin files) and [`fnv1a64`] (short, stable ids in
//! names of files). None of them stands in for a signature. Also bytes
//! written as [`hex`] digits, as digests are.
