//! PaperPaw's storage on a FAT file system (FAT12, FAT16, FAT32) with long
//! file names, e.g. the X4's SD card: [`FatStorage`] over any disk that
//! reads, writes and seeks in bytes (see [`fatfs::ReadWriteSeek`]), such
//! as a [`BlockDisk`] over an SD card's blocks.
//!
//! The [`OPEN_FILES`] files read last stay open, so reading a book a piece
//! at a time, often from two files by turns (an index and its text), does
//! not look them up again for every piece. Files appended to stay open
//! the same way, written back only when they are wanted otherwise (listed,
//! renamed, removed, replaced), when they make room for another file, or on
//! [`Storage::sync`]: a picture decoded into a file in hundreds of pieces
//! is not looked up and written back hundreds of times.
//!
//! The [`FOLDERS`] folders looked up last are kept too: a file opened in
//! one is looked up there, not by walking every folder from the root again
//! (a book's data lies five folders deep, beside those of all other books).
//! Open files and kept folders are found by their paths as FAT names
//! them, without regard to case: a file is open once, however its path
//! is spelt.
//!
//! A [`BlockDisk`] keeps changed blocks too (folders, the FAT) and writes
//! them back in the order they were changed, all of them before a file's
//! data that goes past them: cut off at any point (an empty battery), the
//! card holds the changes up to one of them, none after. Shared with the
//! storage ([`SharedDisk`], [`FatStorage::with_disk`]), it is written
//! back when a call that changes the card returns (but
//! [`Storage::append`]) and on `sync`.
//!
//! Files are written through files beside them named after them
//! (`Temps`): the new content is written whole under one name (`.TMP`)
//! and synced. A new file then takes its name; a file there is replaced:
//! the content is named whole (`.NEW`), then takes the place of the old
//! file (rust-fatfs's `Dir::replace`, as patched for PaperPaw, writes the
//! new entry before it removes the old one and that of `.NEW`, and frees
//! the old clusters last). Cut off at any point, a file reads its old
//! content or its new one, whole, and is listed. What a cut left of a
//! file's write is finished (`settled`) when its folder is first looked
//! at after a start (`settle_folder`), before any file in it is opened:
//! `.NEW` takes the file's place, unless the file was changed after it
//! was made, elsewhere or not: `.NEW` is marked with the file's time,
//! size and first cluster as they were (not told by times alone, as the
//! X4 sets none). New content an earlier version left unmarked is set
//! aside as `<name>.unsaved`, the file kept: whether it changed since
//! cannot be told. A file that cannot be settled is left as it is, its
//! folder in reach; so are the paths of a move that cannot be settled,
//! held up until the next start (`held_up`).
//! The next write, move or removal of a file does the same, so at most
//! one of each is ever left beside it. They are neither listed nor taken
//! by name: one may hold the clusters of the file itself. rust-fatfs, as
//! patched, removes a file's entry before it frees its clusters: cut off
//! between, they stay taken by no file, never a file pointing at free
//! ones. A file's size is its entry's, and reading it fails where its
//! clusters end before (left so by an earlier version).
//!
//! rust-fatfs, as patched, moves an entry by adding the new one before
//! it removes the old one: cut off between, the entry is at both
//! places, its clusters held by both, never at neither, and a folder
//! that cannot grow for it (a full card) fails the move before anything
//! is changed. Where two entries share clusters, one is taken away
//! without freeing them (`unlink`), as a file's temporary file beside
//! its new content (`settled`). A move but a file's to another case of
//! its name is recorded first, in a hidden file of the root
//! ([`JOURNAL`]), and settled after a start before anything else
//! (`settle_moves`): its new place kept, the old entry taken away.
//!
//! Earlier versions wrote files through temporary files of their own
//! (`~pp<n>.tmp`). Such a file may be the only copy of a file whose
//! name is lost, so it is taken away only where it is provably no
//! file's only copy (`clean_old`). Those that stay never stand in the
//! way: none are made any more, and at most 64 were made in a folder.
//!
//! A name stands for an entry by its long name where it has one, by its
//! short name only where it has none: `PAPERP~1`, the short name FAT
//! keeps beside `.paperpaw`, does not reach PaperPaw's data. rust-fatfs
//! takes either, so names are looked up here (`lookup`) and handed to it
//! only where it cannot take another entry for them.

// What goes wrong with the user's data is told, never dropped unseen:
// a result left unread says why (see CONTRIBUTING.md).
