//! Page layout: turns a [`Document`] into pages.
//!
//! Layout is deterministic and starts at any [`Locator`] that begins a line,
//! so a reader only needs to remember where pages start, never the pages
//! themselves. Text is broken greedily per paragraph; because greedy breaking
//! is stable, laying out from the middle of a paragraph yields exactly the
//! same lines as laying out the whole paragraph.
//!
//! The engine knows nothing about fonts or drawing: a [`Typesetter`]
//! measures characters in each [`Face`] (character style, body text or
//! heading level) and kerns pairs of them, and the engine returns
//! positioned lines with their runs of faces. Pairs are kerned within a
//! word and a face only: a line's width is that of its words drawn one by
//! one, each run of a face at once.
