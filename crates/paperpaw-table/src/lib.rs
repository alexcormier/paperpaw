//! The firmware's shared function tables (ADR 0026, #44).
//!
//! A function that every plugin would carry a copy of, and the firmware
//! has anyway, can be *shared*: the crate that has it declares it with
//! [`shared!`] and an index of [`index`]. In the firmware, on computers
//! and phones, and on the X4 Pro's chip it is the function it always was.
//! In a plugin built for a RISC-V chip (`--cfg paperpaw_plugin`) its body
//! is left out and it calls the firmware's copy instead, through its
//! [`Family`]'s table, with Rust's own calling convention, which the
//! plugin interface pins (same compiler, same sources, same layouts).
//!
//! Functions come in families (text, fonts, ...), each with a table of
//! its own and a revision ([`Revisions`]). `paperpaw-plugin.x` makes one
//! word per family, `PAPERPAW_TABLE_0` to `PAPERPAW_TABLE_7`, which the
//! loader fills with the address of the firmware's table (null where it
//! has none); the packer sees which of them a plugin's code reads, so a
//! plugin file says which families it uses. A plugin runs where [`fits`]
//! says so for each of them.
//!
//! `shared.list` is the interface: entries are only ever appended, each
//! at a new revision of its family. `tools/shared-table.py` writes
//! [`index`] and `table.sig` (the signature of every entry) from it.
