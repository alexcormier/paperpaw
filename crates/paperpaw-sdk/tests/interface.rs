//! The plugin interface (`native::INTERFACE`, ADR 0026) holds as long as
//! what plugins see stays as `interface.txt` and the folder `interface/`
//! keep it:
//!
//! - the items and the shapes of the types of every crate that crosses
//!   (`interface/crates.txt`), as each crate's `api.txt` and `shape.txt`
//!   say (`tools/interface.py` writes them);
//! - the linker script plugins are linked with;
//! - the compilers of the release.
//!
//! What changed is raised by hand: by default every change raises the
//! interface. Only what cannot change what a plugin built before relies
//! on goes without: a new type, module or re-export, a new function or
//! constant outside a trait, a new `impl`, and the fields, variants and
//! items of a type that is itself new. A field, a variant or an item of a
//! trait that was there (but at the end of a trait behind a handle,
//! [`GROWING`]), any change of order or of a private field, and anything
//! gone raise it. Either way the files are written anew:
//!
//! PAPERPAW_BLESS=1 cargo test -p paperpaw-sdk --test interface
//!
//! `interface.txt` keeps the fingerprint too ([`fingerprint_line`]): a
//! plugin is loaded where its fingerprint is the firmware's, and the
//! fingerprint holds the interface and the sizes of what crosses, not the
//! order of a trait's items or an enum's variants. So a raise is checked
//! against the interface the kept fingerprint was made at as well, not
//! only against the number `interface.txt` says, and layouts that changed
//! while the shapes did not are a raise too ([`bless_refused`]).
