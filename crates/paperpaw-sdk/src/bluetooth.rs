//! Bluetooth Low Energy (see [ADR 0027](../../../docs/adr/0027-bluetooth.md)):
//! [`Env::bluetooth`](crate::Env::bluetooth) is `Some` where the kernel
//! may use a radio ([`Capabilities::bluetooth`](crate::Capabilities)).
//!
//! A plugin that declares [`Uses::BLUETOOTH`](crate::Uses::BLUETOOTH)
//! asks with the functions of this module, which write
//! [`Command::Bluetooth`], and hears everything as its own events, each a
//! [`BtEvent`]: a scan's on the event it names ([`scan`]), a link's on the
//! link's ([`connect`]), being seen on its own ([`advertise`]), a GATT
//! service's on the service's ([`ServiceSpec`]). Every command is
//! answered, by its result or a [`BtEvent::Failed`] that says which
//! command failed and why.
//!
//! - **Scanning**: [`scan`] finds devices in reach ([`BtEvent::Found`]),
//!   always for a while ([`Scan::lasting`]), by default passively and
//!   seldom ([`ScanPower::Low`]). Several plugins' scans are one scan of
//!   the radio at the cheapest power that serves them all, each plugin
//!   hearing only what passes its own filters.
//! - **A GATT client**: [`connect`] (by default at [`LinkPower::Low`]),
//!   [`discover`] the services, [`read`], [`write()`], [`subscribe`] to
//!   notifications ([`BtEvent::Value`]), or [`subscribe_to`] a service's
//!   characteristic by its UUIDs, handles found by the kernel.
//! - **Pairing** ([`pair`]) is always confirmed by the reader, in the
//!   kernel's own question: a plugin only asks.
//! - **Being seen**: [`advertise`] for a while, and a GATT server of
//!   services declared at registration
//!   ([`Registrar::add_gatt_service`](crate::Registrar::add_gatt_service)):
//!   centrals' reads and writes come as events, answered with [`respond`]
//!   or [`refuse`], and [`notify_centrals`] sends to those subscribed.
//! - **Keys of a remote or a keyboard**: a bonded device that types is the
//!   kernel's: [`remote_keys`] connects it and its keys arrive as buttons
//!   of the key maps (`button.hid.right`, `button.hid.page-down` …), with
//!   no plugin parsing its reports. A plugin a device is given to may ask
//!   for the reports themselves ([`hid_reports`]).
//!
//! A plugin sees only devices its own scans found and bonded devices the
//! reader gave it; anything else fails with [`BtError::NotFound`].
//! Devices are known by a [`DeviceId`], never by their address. The
//! Bluetooth manager (the plugin whose screen is bound to
//! [`slots::BLUETOOTH`](crate::builtin::slots::BLUETOOTH)) sees every
//! bond; forgetting and giving otherwise count only as the reader's own
//! doing. Events written out for others (observers, rules) carry no
//! payloads. Scans, links and advertising end with the screen that was
//! showing when they were asked for (unless declared work asked for
//! them), and all before the device sleeps; the radio is off whenever
//! nothing needs it.
//!
