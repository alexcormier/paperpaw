//! Bars that stay across the screens shown: tabs, a dock, a bar of
//! one's own along an edge (see [`ChromeSpec`]).
//!
//! A bar is an ordinary [`Screen`](crate::Screen), made by its factory
//! for a strip along an edge of the screen; the screens below it get the
//! rest. It draws into its strip (its `(0, 0)` is the strip's corner, and
//! [`Env::content`](crate::Env::content) is the strip), takes the taps,
//! long presses and swipes that begin in it, hears every event, and stays
//! as screens open and close. Whether it shows over a screen is its own
//! choice ([`ChromeSpec::shown`]), e.g. not over the reader; where a
//! screen guards the device (the lock), no bar shows. On devices without
//! touch, what a bar does is better bound to buttons as actions
//! (`tabs.next`), and the bar left to touch devices ([`ChromeSpec::need`]).
