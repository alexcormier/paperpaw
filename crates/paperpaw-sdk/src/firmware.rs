//! Firmware updates, on devices whose firmware PaperPaw is (the X4):
//! [`Env::firmware`](crate::Env) is `Some` there. Elsewhere PaperPaw is
//! an app, updated by the system's store.
//!
//! The shell does what it is told ([`Command::Firmware`](crate::Command)
//! with a [`FirmwareCommand`]: install an update file, restart) and
//! reports how it goes in [`Firmware::state`], with
//! [`events::FIRMWARE_CHANGED`](crate::builtin::events::FIRMWARE_CHANGED).
//! Finding updates and asking the reader is a plugin's (the `update`
//! plugin, which another can replace).
//!
//! Update files are signed (the format is `paperpaw-update`'s, its parts
//! are here too). The shell installs those signed with one of
//! [`Firmware::keys`] (PaperPaw's); one signed with another key (the
//! reader's own builds) only with that key in the command, which the
//! reader accepted for this install, shown its fingerprint; and one not
//! newer than the running firmware only when the reader chose it
//! ([`Update::may_install`]). Nothing on the card makes a key trusted or
//! an older firmware welcome, so a card changed by someone else cannot
//! install firmware unasked. The shell writes the new firmware beside the
//! running one and starts it at the next start; if the new one does not
//! start cleanly, the old one comes back ([`Firmware::undone`]). Books,
//! settings and plugins on the card stay as they are.
