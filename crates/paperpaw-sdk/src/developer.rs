//! The developer link over USB (see
//! [ADR 0031](../../../docs/adr/0031-developer-link.md)): a plugin of
//! developer tools that the reader installed brings what test builds do
//! over USB (files in and out, presses, the screen, the memory, timings)
//! to released firmware. The firmware itself stays without it.
//!
//! A plugin that declares [`Uses::DEVELOPER`](crate::Uses::DEVELOPER)
//! opens the link with [`open`] and hears everything on the event it
//! names, each a [`DevEvent`]: opened, bytes from the computer, the
//! screen it asked for, closed, failed. It writes with [`write`](fn@write), asks
//! for the screen with [`screen`] and closes with [`close`]. Presses,
//! actions, files and the memory are the plugin's as for any other
//! (`Command::Input`, `Command::RunAction`, `Env::storage`,
//! `Env::memory`), so the tools need no commands of their own for them.
//!
//! The kernel keeps it safe, not the plugin: the link opens only while
//! the reader allowed it under *Developer*, confirmed on the device; the
//! status line shows it while it is open; a restart ends it unless the
//! reader kept it on; secrets are never readable over it; the firmware's
//! own log and the update path go first on the wire.
//!
//! In this release the link is reserved, not carried out: every [`open`]
//! is answered [`DevError::NotAvailable`]. A later firmware fills it in
//! without a new plugin interface; the requests and events have room for
//! more ([`DevCommand`] and [`DevEvent`] are not exhaustive).
