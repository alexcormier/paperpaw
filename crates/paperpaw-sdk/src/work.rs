//! Declared work: what a plugin wants done, with what it needs and by
//! when, run by the kernel at the moment that costs least (ADR 0025).
//!
//! A plugin does not reach the network on its own account in the
//! background. It declares the work ([`Command::Work`]), and when it is
//! time the kernel emits the work's event with its parameters, as a
//! timer would; the plugin does the work then. The kernel runs together
//! everything that needs the network, so a reading session costs one
//! short connection when it starts and one when it ends:
//!
//! ```
//! use core::time::Duration;
//! use paperpaw_sdk::work::{Moments, Work};
//! use paperpaw_sdk::{Command, Id};
//!
//! const PUSH: Id = Id::new_static("kosync.push");
//! // The position: at the next natural moment, at the latest in 30 min.
//! let push = Work::network(PUSH)
//!     .expected()
//!     .within(Duration::from_secs(30 * 60))
//!     .at_moments(Moments::BOOK_CLOSED | Moments::SLEEP | Moments::ONLINE);
//! let command = Command::Work(push);
//! # let _ = command;
//! ```
//!
//! - **The id** is an event of the plugin, and a **key** tells apart
//!   several works of one event ([`Work::key`], e.g. a timer for each
//!   rule). Declaring the same id and key again replaces the work;
//!   [`Command::CancelWork`] takes it back.
//! - **What it needs**: nothing, the network ([`Work::network`]), the
//!   device charging ([`Work::charging`]).
//! - **How much the reader counts on it**: [`expected`](Work::expected)
//!   work is done, at the latest by its deadline;
//!   [`optional`](Work::optional) work is done when it is cheap and left
//!   out when it is not.
//! - **When**: not before ([`after`](Work::after)), at the latest
//!   ([`within`](Work::within); without one, only when it is cheap), or
//!   exactly ([`Work::at`], a timer); [`every`](Work::every) declares it
//!   again after each run.
//! - **At which moments** it may run ([`Moments`]): waking, a book opened
//!   or closed, going to sleep, the radio on anyway, charging, idle.
//!
//! **Its event is background work**, whatever brought it due: what the
//! handler says becomes the plugin's note, and its requests are not the
//! reader's. Its requests keep the radio on until they are answered.
//!
//! **Jobs** are work in steps: long work (an install, a catalog synced or
//! walked, a book's pages counted) registers a step function for its id
//! ([`WorkSpec`], [`Registrar::add_work`]). When it runs, the kernel calls
//! the step instead of emitting the event, again while it answers
//! [`Step::Continue`], each time after the frame is drawn and only when no
//! input waits, so the device answers at once and sleeps between steps.
//! A step should take a few milliseconds.
//!
//! [`Registrar::add_work`]: crate::Registrar::add_work
//!
//! **Nothing is refused silently, nothing nags.** Work held back by the
//! power mode stays queued and runs when allowed; work that can never run
//! (the reader switched the plugin's network off, the manifest does not
//! declare it) is taken out with [`events::WORK_REFUSED`] and a
//! [`Refusal`] saying why and when to try again. A request that does not
//! go out is answered with one too ([`HttpReply::refused`]). None of this
//! is ever shown over reading: background work cannot raise notices, its
//! [`Command::Notify`] becomes the plugin's note, shown on its own page,
//! the Power page and the battery view.
