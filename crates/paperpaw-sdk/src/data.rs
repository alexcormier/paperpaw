//! Versioned formats of the files plugins keep their data in.
//!
//! What PaperPaw keeps on the card stays readable by every later version:
//! a file's format has a version, and a plugin that changes it in a way
//! older readers would misread raises the version and adds the step from
//! the one before ([`Format::upgrades`]). Files are upgraded as they are
//! read, in memory, and written in the new format when they are saved
//! next. Adding a key to an ini file needs no new version: readers skip
//! keys they do not know.
//!
//! A text file says its version in its first line, `# format 2`; a file
//! without that line is version 1, so files from before versions came
//! need no change. A firmware or app older than a file (after going back
//! to an older update) does not read it and does not write over it: it
//! stays as the newer version left it ([`Error::Newer`]).
//!
//! Binary files change their name for a new version instead (e.g.
//! `pages.bin` to `pages2.bin`), caches their stamp: they are made again.
//! Each format's versions have files in the repository that the tests
//! read (see `docs/data-files.md`).
