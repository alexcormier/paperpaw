//! Icons by name, e.g. `books` or `settings`, drawn from the icon font
//! bound to [`fonts::ICONS`](crate::builtin::fonts::ICONS).
//!
//! The names are those of [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons), all of
//! them known here; the icon font holds the drawings of those PaperPaw
//! uses (see `tools/icons/subset.py`), icon packs add others (font packs
//! that extend it, see `tools/icons/pack.py`). An icon theme is a font
//! with other drawings at the same code points, bound to the role in
//! place of the default.
//!
//! Plugins give their menu entries icons by name
//! ([`Registrar::add_icon`](crate::Registrar::add_icon)); an icon without
//! a drawing draws nothing.
//!
//! A native plugin file (ADR 0024) built with `--cfg paperpaw_plugin`
//! (as `samples/hello-native` builds) asks the firmware for an icon's
//! character instead of carrying the names of all of them.
