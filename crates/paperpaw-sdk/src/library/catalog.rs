//! The catalog: every book under the library folder with what the
//! library knows of it (author, title, series, number, tags, how far it
//! is read, whether it is a favourite or was opened, when it was added,
//! the fields plugins keep in it), for views of the library, its filters
//! and searches, without reading each book's details.
//!
//! It is kept in `.paperpaw/library/catalog.txt`, a book a line, and only
//! the kernel writes it, one change at a time, in the background: made
//! anew from the library folder (`Walk`) when the library is first shown
//! after a start, when books came or went without a word and for another
//! library folder, taking each book whose file did not change from the
//! old catalog, others from their details, opening only books not seen
//! before; caught up (`Rewrite`) after books came or moved. Until a new
//! one is complete, the old one is read. It is read a piece at a time,
//! never held in memory.
//!
//! How far a book is read, whether it is a favourite, and that a book was
//! removed change while the catalog stands: they are appended to a short
//! log beside it (`status.log`) and read with it ([`Changes`]), and
//! folded into it at a calm moment once the log is long, so a page turned
//! never rewrites the catalog. What was noted before a catalog was made
//! is in it, and goes from the log.
//!
//! The first line of a catalog of this format is a header (`\tcatalog\t2`
//! and its [`generation`]); a catalog of format 1 (six columns, no
//! status) is still read.
