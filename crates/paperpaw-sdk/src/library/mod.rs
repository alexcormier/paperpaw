//! The library as a service: what is known about books beyond their
//! files, for every plugin that shows or uses them (the library, the home
//! screen, the sleep screen, syncs). Data and the screens that show it
//! are apart: any plugin may offer another view of the same books.
//!
//! - A book's details: title, author, series, tags and cover, read from
//!   the book once ([`index`](fn@index)), its reading progress, and fields that
//!   plugins add (e.g. a rating or where a book came from), in
//!   `.paperpaw/library/books/<hash>.ini`.
//! - The books opened last, most recent first (`opened.txt`), and the
//!   favourites (`favourites.txt`).
//! - The catalog of all books under the library folder ([`catalog`]),
//!   and listings of a folder's books ([`listing`]).
//!
//! The kernel keeps them up to date from the standard reading events and
//! moves them with a book ([`record`], [`moved`]). Nothing here grows
//! with the size of the library: the lists are capped, and details are
//! read a book at a time.
