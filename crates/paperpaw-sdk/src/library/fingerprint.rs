//! What a book is by its content, apart from where it lies: its size and
//! KOReader's partial MD5 ([`md5::partial`]). The path's hash
//! ([`key`](super::key)) names a book's files; the fingerprint, kept in
//! them beside it, says which file they were made of, so the same book
//! is known again where it was renamed or moved by other means than
//! PaperPaw, and another file at the same path is told from it.
//!
//! Reading it takes 12 reads of 1 KiB at most, whatever the book's size:
//! a reader takes it once when it opens a book and keeps it while it is
//! open.
