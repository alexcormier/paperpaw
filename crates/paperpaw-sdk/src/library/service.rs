//! The library as a service: one place every view of the books asks

//! by Calibre's database, say), and what plugins add to every view of a
//! book: fields kept with it ([`BookField`]) and badges on its row
//! ([`BookBadge`]).
//!
//! The kernel's library (the default) keeps what it knows in
//! `.paperpaw/library`: each book's details, the books read last, the
//! favourites and the catalog ([`catalog`], [`index`](mod@super::index)). A replacement
//! publishes itself as the service [`SERVICE`]
//! ([`Registrar::provide`](crate::Registrar::provide), a
//! [`LibraryService`] holding a `Box<dyn Library>`) and answers the same questions its own way; views
//! that ask [`service`] show its books.
