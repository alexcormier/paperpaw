//! Native code plugins (ADR 0024): a plugin built into a file that a
//! device loads at its start, without a new firmware. It runs as part of
//! PaperPaw, with no sandbox, and its code is the same as a plugin built
//! in: one more crate makes the file, with [`plugin!`](crate::plugin).
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #![no_std]
//! #![no_main]
//!
//! paperpaw_sdk::plugin!(my_plugin::MyPlugin::default());
//! ```
//!
//! A plugin file fits a PaperPaw of the same plugin interface
//! ([`INTERFACE`]: what of the SDK plugins see, the layouts of the types
//! that cross, the firmware's table, how a plugin is linked), built for
//! the same chip with the features that change what crosses. Until
//! PaperPaw 1.0 the SDK's types cross between them as they are, so the
//! compiler is the release's too (`shells/xteink/rust-toolchain.toml`,
//! `versions.env`), and a new one is a new interface (ADR 0026).
//! [`FINGERPRINT`] says which, and a device loads only files with its own
//! ([`Native::fingerprint`]); its top 16 bits are the interface's version,
//! so a file of another can say so ([`Fingerprint::interface`]). A plugin
//! built for an interface runs on every PaperPaw of it, whichever release
//! made the plugin. `docs/plugins.md` says how a plugin is built, packed
//! (`paperpaw-sign pack`), signed and published.
//!
//! A code plugin is a folder like a data plugin's (`plugin.ini`,
//! translations, settings) with its code as [`Native::file`]; the kernel
//! loads the code of those switched on at the start, and switching one
//! takes a restart. Where PaperPaw loads code plugins, [`Env::native`]
//! says with what (the store takes the build that fits), and whether this
//! start went without them ([`SafeMode`]).
//!
//! [`Env::native`]: crate::Env
