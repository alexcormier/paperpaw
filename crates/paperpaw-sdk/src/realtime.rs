//! Screens that run in real time: games, emulators, animations, drawings
//! that follow the pen ([ADR 0030]).
//!
//! A screen says once how it runs ([`Screen::mode`], a [`ScreenMode`]):
//! full screen, buttons pressed and released, refreshes it chooses
//! itself, the fastest refresh, a pace. The device says what it can do
//! and what it did ([`Env::panel`], a [`PanelInfo`]): how fast each
//! refresh is, and how the last frame went. A plugin paces itself by
//! that, so faster panels make it faster without a new build.
//!
//! Both are values of a fixed size with room to grow: a later option or
//! number takes a free place, which a plugin built before leaves empty
//! (meaning as before), and which a firmware built before ignores.
