//! Filters: stages where plugins look at what passes and may change it.
//!
//! - [Text filters](TextFilterSpec): between a book's format and the
//!   layout of its pages.
//! - [Input filters](InputFilterSpec): every button and finger before
//!   anything else sees it, e.g. to lock the screen, or touch while
//!   reading.
//! - [Refresh filters](RefreshFilterSpec): how the panel is refreshed,
//!   e.g. always in full while reading.
//!
//! Text filters are a stage between a book's format and the layout of its
//! pages. Each filter gets every block before it is laid out and may
//! change it: style parts of it (e.g. bold word beginnings), replace text
//! ([`Block::replace`](crate::document::Block::replace) keeps positions in
//! the book right), or leave it.
//!
//! Plugins add filters with
//! [`Registrar::add_text_filter`](crate::Registrar::add_text_filter); a
//! filter decides from the settings whether it does anything. Its
//! signature tells readers when its effect changed, so pages are laid out
//! anew (and kept apart from pages laid out without it). A block filter
//! ([`TextFilterSpec::block`]) also knows where the block is (the book,
//! its language, the place: [`FilterContext`]) and may leave the block
//! out ([`Verdict::Drop`]), e.g. a web page's adverts or a book's
//! printed page numbers.
