//! Widgets: small boxes plugins contribute for screens that show them,
//! such as the home screen's pages (a clock, the book being read, today's
//! reading, a grid of tools). Any plugin adds widgets with
//! [`Registrar::add_widget`](crate::Registrar::add_widget); screens let
//! the user choose which to show and where.
//!
//! A screen that shows a widget makes it ([`Widgets::make`]) and keeps
//! it: the widget reads what it shows when the screen updates it (when
//! it shows, about each minute, after events), and draws from that, so
//! drawing stays quick ([`Widget`]). Widgets with nothing to read, such
//! as a clock, are a pair of functions ([`WidgetSpec::drawn`]).
//!
//! A widget may have targets: places that do something when tapped, which
//! buttons reach one after the other too (see [`WidgetTarget`]).
//!
//! A widget may have settings of its own, e.g. where its text sits
//! ([`align_setting`]): they go in a settings group with the widget's id
//! ([`settings_group`]). The settings list leaves such groups out; screens
//! that edit widgets open them (slot
//! [`SETTINGS`](crate::builtin::slots::SETTINGS) with parameter
//! [`ID`](crate::builtin::params::ID)).
//!
//! The kernel brings two widgets for room between the others, which a list
//! may hold more than once ([`repeatable`]): [`SPACE`], a gap of a set
//! height, and [`FILL`], the room the others leave. Screens that place
//! widgets one below the other give each fill its share of that room
//! ([`fill_height`]); elsewhere it is not there.
//!
//! Screens that show widgets in a grid, as the home screen does, use
//! [`grid`]: its layout as data, and a view that edits it in place.
//! Screens that show them above each other, as the sleep screen does, use
//! a [`WidgetStack`]. Either way the screen asks [`refresh`] what an event means
//! for the widgets it shows, and reads the live ones anew each minute
//! ([`next_minute`]).
//!
//! The places where widgets show are [`WidgetPlace`]s
//! ([`Registrar::add_widget_place`](crate::Registrar::add_widget_place)):
//! the settings that list them, and whether they show in a grid or above
//! each other. A plugin asks whether any place shows its widget
//! ([`Widgets::shown`]), e.g. to fetch the weather only then; the slot
//! [`EDIT_WIDGETS`](crate::builtin::slots::EDIT_WIDGETS) edits a place's
//! list.
//!
//! Widgets share a look the reader shapes for each ([`Frame`], [`TextSize`],
//! [`draw_caption`], see [`widget_look`]), and say which kind they are
//! ([`categories`]), so that screens offering many of them group them.
//!
//! A widget may instead preview a group of settings
//! ([`WidgetSpec::previews`]), e.g. a sample of text laid out as the
//! reading settings say: settings pages show it above the group's
//! settings, and while a value is being chosen it shows that one
//! ([`Command::PreviewSettings`](crate::Command::PreviewSettings)). It is
//! not offered among the widgets for other screens.
