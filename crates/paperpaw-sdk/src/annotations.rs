//! The bookmarks and highlights of books, shared by plugins: the reader
//! makes and shows them, others export or sync them (e.g. with KOReader).
//! Whoever changes those of a book emits
//! [`ANNOTATIONS_CHANGED`](events::ANNOTATIONS_CHANGED)
//! (see [`changed`]), so readers show them anew and syncs pass them on.
//!
//! A book's annotations are kept in `.paperpaw/annotations/<hash>.txt`
//! (the hash of the book's path), one per line, sorted by position: kind
//! (`b` or `h`), start and end (section and offset, so they outlast font
//! sizes and layouts), the reading progress, when it was made and last
//! changed (seconds since 1970, 0 if not known), a snippet of the text
//! and the note on it, separated by tabs.
//!
//! Offsets are those of one conversion of the book: with its own styles
//! or without, say, the same text is at other offsets. So from version 2
//! on (first line `# format 2`) each line also says, after the times,
//! which conversion its offsets are in (16 hex digits, see
//! [`relocate`]) and its start and end as XPointers, which fit every
//! conversion (empty where there are none; the end is empty where it is
//! the start). The conversion is empty for one added since, and `?` for
//! one kept before conversions were, whose conversion is not known. A
//! file with only those of before stays in version 1.
//!
//! Which book they are of, by its content ([`Fingerprint`]), is said in
//! a line `# book <size> <md5>` after the version's (see [`stamp`]): a
//! line PaperPaw of before reads as none of its own and keeps as it
//! is, so the version stays.
