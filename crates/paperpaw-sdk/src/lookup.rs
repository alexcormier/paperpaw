//! Lookup providers: where a word is looked up, for whatever screen shows
//! it (the standard one is the dictionary's panel in the slot
//! [`slots::LOOKUP`](crate::builtin::slots::LOOKUP)).
//!
//! A provider ([`LookupProviderSpec`], `Registrar::add_lookup_provider`)
//! answers a [`LookupQuery`] at once with its entries
//! ([`LookupAnswer::Ready`]), or starts work (an HTTP request, say) and
//! answers later ([`LookupAnswer::Pending`]): its plugin then emits the
//! query's reply ([`LookupQuery::answer`], an
//! [`events::LookupAnswered`](crate::builtin::events::LookupAnswered)),
//! keeping the reply's id with its request.
//!
//! The screen in the lookup slot asks the providers
//! ([`LookupProviders::ask`]) and shows every entry with the name of its
//! provider. Those that go online it asks only when the reader chooses
//! to (the shipped panel's *Online*), never with every word.
//!
//! Privacy: that rule is the asking screen's, not the kernel's, and a
//! provider that goes online sends the word where it asks. The answer
//! goes to the asker's reply event (a screen's own id, by default
//! [`events::LOOKUP_ANSWERED`](crate::builtin::events::LOOKUP_ANSWERED)):
//! only plugins that listen for that event hear it, but every open
//! screen sees every event, as with all events.
