//! Widgets in a grid, like a phone's home screen: an area cut into cells
//! (columns and rows), each item taking a rectangle of them: a widget (any
//! plugin's) or a tool (an action, shown as its icon and name). Cells left
//! empty stay empty, so everything sits where it was put.
//!
//! The layout is data: a text such as
//! `home.clock 0/0 4x1, tool:files.library 0/5` ([`parse`], [`write()`]),
//! each item its id, its column and row, and its size in cells, kept where
//! the plugin likes (a setting, a file). An item without a place (as
//! plugins add them) goes into the first free cells ([`place`]), as wide as
//! the grid and as high as it needs.
//!
//! [`GridView`] shows such a grid on a screen of the plugin's own, and edits
//! it in place: drag an item to move it, by its corner to size it, tap it
//! for its options (move or size it with the buttons, its settings, remove
//! it). With buttons alone, the focus goes from item to item.
//!
