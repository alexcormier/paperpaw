//! Status items: small pieces of information shown in a status line, such
//! as the time, the battery or the page.
//!
//! Any plugin adds items with
//! [`Registrar::add_status_item`](crate::Registrar::add_status_item);
//! screens with a status line let the user choose which items it shows and
//! where (the reader does this for its lines above and below the text).
//! An item computes its value from the environment and from the context the
//! screen passes, e.g. the reader's `title`, `chapter`, `page` and
//! `progress` (see [`context`]).
//!
//! An item may do something when it is tapped ([`StatusItemSpec::tap`]:
//! the battery opens its settings), and says how much it matters
//! ([`StatusItemSpec::priority`]): where a line has no room for all its
//! items, those that matter least are left out first, never cut.
//!
//! Plugins can also add whole status lines
//! ([`Registrar::add_status_line`](crate::Registrar::add_status_line)),
//! which draw the line themselves: a progress bar, a large clock, anything.
//! The reader offers the lines the user chose, above and below the text,
//! and switches between them when the line is tapped.
//!
//! The places where status items show are [`Place`]s
//! ([`Registrar::add_status_place`](crate::Registrar::add_status_place)):
//! three settings of the items for a line's left, centre and right. The
//! reader has one above and one below the text, the home screen one in
//! its status widget, the quick panel one at its head; a status line
//! drawn in a place is told which ([`StatusFrame::place`]).
