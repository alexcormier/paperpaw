//! Bluetooth (see [ADR 0027](../../../docs/adr/0027-bluetooth.md)): the
//! radio the shell drives, shared by plugins. The kernel keeps each
//! plugin's scans, links and advertising, numbers links for the shell,
//! lets a plugin see only devices it found or was given, answers every
//! command, turns a bonded remote's reports into keys, runs the radio at
//! the cheapest power that serves everyone, and switches it on for the
//! first request and off a little after the last.
