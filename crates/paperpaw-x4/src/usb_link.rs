//! Whether a computer is talking over the USB cable, from the number of the
//! USB frames the unit last received (#209). A computer sends a frame every
//! millisecond, so the number moves on by about as many as milliseconds pass;
//! nothing else does that. The firmware (`shells/xteink`, `usb_power.rs`)
//! reads the number; this is the judgement of the readings, on a
//! computer-tested machine.
//!
//! A reading that merely differs from the one before is not a bus: a unit
//! that reads noise, or a number that jumps, differs as well. Here the
//! number has to move on the way a bus moves it, in two steps one after the
//! other ([`advancing`]), and that has to be found at two looks a second
//! apart before it counts ([`Link`]); a still number ends it at once.
