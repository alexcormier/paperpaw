//! PaperPaw as one of two firmwares on one X4 (#95): when a tool starts it
//! from a slot beside another firmware's, PaperPaw must never write the
//! other slot nor the OTA data that chooses between them. Phase 1 knows two
//! ways to be *declared* such a firmware, for any tool (nothing here is made
//! for one):
//!
//! - the reader writes `dual-boot = on` in the `[firmware]` section of
//!   `paperpaw.ini` (`off` says the opposite and wins; `auto`, the default,
//!   follows the marker), or
//! - the tool's bootloader carries the marker string [`MARKER`] anywhere in
//!   the bootloader's window of the flash (0 to [`WINDOW`]), or the tag
//!   [`X4BOOT`] of the X4 dualbooter's (lowio.xyz) bootloader, a tool that
//!   was made before this contract.
//!
//! [`Evidence`] is what [`decide`] weighs; a later phase adds what it
//! finds by itself (another firmware's image in the other slot, a bootloader
//! that is not the stock one) as a candidate that asks before replacing.
//! This is the part that decides, on a computer-tested footing; the firmware
//! (`shells/xteink`) reads the flash and the card and does as it says.
