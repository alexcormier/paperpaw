//! Updates over the air, the parts that can be tested on a computer: the
//! OTA data partition, whose two entries choose the app partition the
//! bootloader starts and keep the state of its image ([`OtaData`]), and an
//! update's image, written so that it can start only once it is whole and
//! its signature held ([`Image`]). The firmware (`shells/xteink/src/ota.rs`)
//! finds the partitions, checks the signature and decides when.
//!
//! The entries are ESP-IDF's: a sequence number, a label the bootloader
//! does not read, the image's state and the CRC of the sequence number.
//! The one with the higher sequence number is in force; its number less
//! one, modulo the app partitions, is the partition it chooses. Choosing
//! writes the other entry whole (sequence number and state at once), so a
//! power cut keeps the choice before; the entry in force stays the way
//! back. The label keeps how long an update ran on trial, so that the
//! trial goes on across the X4's starts from sleep.
