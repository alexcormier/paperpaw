//! The X4's display: a GDEQ0426T82 panel (800 × 480, black and white)
//! driven by an SSD1677 controller over SPI.
//!
//! The controller has two memories of the whole panel: the frame to show
//! (*new*) and the frame shown (*shown*), which a fast refresh compares
//! with, to move only the pixels that change. PaperPaw draws the screen
//! upright (480 × 800) in bands of rows, aligned to 8 (see
//! `KernelBuilder::row_align`); [`Display::write_rows`] writes each band
//! turned into one or both memories:
//!
//! - **Full** and **half** refreshes: the band goes into both, then
//!   [`Display::refresh`].
//! - **Fast** refreshes: the band goes into *new*, then
//!   [`Display::refresh`], then the same bands again into *shown*
//!   (`Kernel::rerender`), for the next one to compare with.
//!
//! So the firmware keeps no frame of its own: 48 KB of the 192 KB it has
//! stay free.
//!
//! The upright screen is the panel turned clockwise: the screen's row `y`
//! is the controller's column `y`, its column `x` the controller's row
//! `x` (its gates are wired bottom to top). A byte of the controller's
//! memory holds 8 pixels of a row (the most significant bit first; set
//! for white), so 8 rows of the screen.
//!
//! In four grays ([`Display::write_gray_rows`], [`Display::refresh_gray`]),
//! the two memories hold the two bits of each pixel's gray, shown with the
//! stock firmware's gray waveform; the next refresh then drives every
//! pixel again.
//!
//! Turned ([`Display::set_rotation`]), the screen is 800 × 480 on its side
//! or 480 × 800 upside down; its rows go into the controller's memory as
//! they lie on the panel (on its side, a row of the screen is a row of the
//! controller's).
