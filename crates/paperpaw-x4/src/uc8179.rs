//! The UltraChip displays: an 800 × 480 panel driven by a UC8179 or a
//! UC8279 controller over SPI (the X4 Pro and the X4 Classic have either,
//! by batch; see [`probe`](crate::probe)), with the same calls as
//! [`display`](crate::display), so the firmware drives any.
//!
//! The controller keeps two frames: the new one (`DTM2`) and the one
//! shown (`DTM1`), which a fast refresh compares with. Where there is the
//! memory for it (the X4 Pro's PSRAM), the driver keeps the frame too
//! ([`Frame::Kept`]): [`Display::write_rows`] draws PaperPaw's bands into
//! it, each refresh sends it whole, and after a refresh it goes into the
//! frame shown too, for the next fast one to compare with. Where there is
//! not ([`Frame::InController`], a device with the X4's 192 KB), the bands
//! go straight into the controller's frames as the SSD1677's do, each
//! through a window of the controller's memory (`PTL`, entered with
//! `PTIN` and left with `PTOUT`): into the new frame, the one shown or
//! both, as [`Planes`] says (laid out as for the SSD1677).
//!
//! The controller addresses 800 × 600 pixels (`TRES`); the panel shows
//! 480 of the lines: on a UC8179 the first, sent last line first, on a
//! UC8279 the last, in order. A byte holds 8 pixels of a line, the
//! leftmost in the highest bit, set for white. PaperPaw draws the screen
//! upright (480 × 800): the panel turned, the screen's row `y` the
//! controller's column `y`, its column `x` the controller's line `x` on a
//! UC8179 (as seen on the device: the other way it shows mirrored) and
//! `599 - x` on a UC8279.
//!
//! The refreshes use the panel's own waveforms (`PSR` 0x1F on a UC8179,
//! 0x17 on a UC8279), chosen by the temperature told (`TSSET`): 30 °C
//! drives every pixel (full and half), 90 °C the fast waveform, only where
//! the two frames differ. A UC8279 forgets its panel setting when its
//! power comes on (it is set again after) and refreshes fast only within
//! a window. These sequences are the ones the FreeInk SDK records for the
//! X4 Pro from its stock firmware (MIT licence), as Papyrix uses them.
//!
//! Four grays ([`Display::write_gray_rows`], [`Display::refresh_gray`])
//! come in two steps on a UC8179 with its frame kept, as in the FreeInk
//! SDK: the frame is shown in black and white first, every gray black;
//! then the SDK's gray waveforms (`PSR` 0x3F, from the LUT registers)
//! lighten the grays, chosen by a code in *old* and *new*: 00 not at all
//! (black), 11 a little (dark gray), 10 more (light gray); white, already
//! white, takes 11 too. The next refresh after them drives every pixel
//! back to black or white, as a half refresh if a fast one was asked (the
//! SDK's waveforms for a fast one leave the grays a little light). The
//! first step needs the frame kept, the UC8279 waveforms of its own that
//! are not known yet: otherwise grays are shown in black and white.
