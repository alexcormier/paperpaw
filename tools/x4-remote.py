r"""Drives PaperPaw on an Xteink X4 over USB: presses its buttons, takes
screenshots and tells what the screen shows, as the emulator's scripts do
(see shells/desktop/src/headless.rs). The commands are described in
crates/paperpaw-x4/src/remote.rs, the firmware's side is in
shells/xteink/src/remote.rs (its `remote` feature: released firmware
leaves it out).

Usage:
  python tools/x4-remote.py [--port COM10] [--script STEPS] [--screenshot FILE]
  python tools/x4-remote.py --log 30     (the X4's log for 30 seconds)
  python tools/x4-remote.py --put book.epub books/book.epub   (a file onto its card,
      checked by its MD5 once there)
  python tools/x4-remote.py --get .paperpaw/plugins/battery/log.csv log.csv   (one off it)
  python tools/x4-remote.py --push fonts/ .paperpaw/fonts   (a folder, all in it)
  python tools/x4-remote.py --pull .paperpaw/plugins/stats stats/   (a folder off it)
  python tools/x4-remote.py --ls books   --cat paperpaw.ini   --rm updates/old.bin
  python tools/x4-remote.py --mkdir books/new   --mv books/a.epub books/b.epub
  python tools/x4-remote.py --trust-code hello   (one's own build of a code plugin,
      copied into plugins/hello by hand, named as installed: only code installed runs)
  python tools/x4-remote.py --info     (version, plugins, native code, the screens open, the time)
  python tools/x4-remote.py --crashes  (the crash file, its calls named from the
      firmware's symbols: the build that crashed must be the one built here)
  python tools/x4-remote.py --profile --script "page-forward,wait:2000"
      (where the time goes during the steps: the functions the processor
      was in most, from the firmware's symbols; needs rustup's llvm-tools)

STEPS, separated by commas:
  page-forward       a short press of a button (back, confirm, left, right,
                     page-back, page-forward, power)
  long:confirm       a long press
  hold:confirm:2000  a press held so many milliseconds
  open:books/a.epub  open a book in the reader
  run:calibre.open   run an action, as a button bound to it would (e.g. a
                     tool's, to open it at once)
  slot:core.settings:id=reader   open a slot, with parameters (key=value)
  show:calibre.screen   open a screen by its id (also :key=value …)
  set:core.night-mode=on   set a setting, as the settings screen would (the
                     value as configuration files write it; `\,` for a
                     comma in it, e.g. a home page's widgets)
  setting:reader.font-size print a setting's value
  type:hello world   text into the text field shown (the keyboard's), as if
                     typed on its keys (`\,` for a comma)
  type-enter:hello   the same, then confirmed (`type-enter:` confirms only)
  wait:500           500 ms pass
  screen             print the screen's id
  describe           print what the screen shows, part by part
  heap               print the heap used and free, and the stack never used, in bytes
  gray               four grays on the panel to judge them (bars, a gradient)
  gray:.paperpaw/…/cover.gray   with a decoded gray picture below
  graytone:middle    how dark the X4's grays between come out from now on
                     (stock, middle), to compare them
  refresh:full       refresh the panel from what the controller holds (also
                     refresh:fast), nothing sent
  input              print how the buttons and the battery are read
  shot:out/a.png     a screenshot now

  Waiting and checking (a script with a failed check ends with exit code 1):
  until:Settings     wait until the screen shows this text (at most 30 s)
  until:Settings:5000  at most 5 s
  expect:Settings    check that the screen shows this text now
  expect-not:Error   check that it does not
  screens            print the screens open, the one shown last
  boot               why the X4 last started, and the panic before if any

  Touch (the X4 Pro), where PaperPaw draws:
  tap:240:400        a tap there
  swipe:240:700:240:100   a finger from one point to the other (also :ms)
  drag:240:700:240:100:40:15  the same as the touch controller reads it
  clicks:right:30:800:100  a button clicked 30 times 800 ms apart, held
                     100 ms each, read as its own readings are
                     (40 moves 15 ms apart, also while PaperPaw is busy)
  tap-label:Search online  a tap in the middle of what shows that text

  The card (paths as PaperPaw writes them, from the card's top):
  ls:books  stat:books/a.epub  md5:books/a.epub  rm:updates  mkdir:books/new
  mv:books/a.epub>books/b.epub   sync   cat:paperpaw.ini

  What runs, and changes:
  version            the firmware's version and the plugin crates built in
  plugins            every plugin, on or off, with its version (and whether it
                     has native code, and why that does not run)
  native             where native code plugins lie, or why there is no room
  actions:reader.    the actions (those beginning so; all without)
  settings:reader.   the settings and their values
  usage              what each plugin took since start: time, calls,
                     refreshes, bytes read and written (busiest first)
  time               the clock; time:set sets it to this computer's
  log:debug          how much the log says (off, error, warn, info, debug, trace)
  wifi:status  wifi:scan  wifi:off   the radio (join with --wifi-connect)
  http:get:http://host/file>books/f.epub   a plain-HTTP request as plugins make
                     them, into memory or a file, with its time and the heap
  emit:core.book-opened:path=books/a.epub   an event, as a plugin sends it
  restart            the X4 starts again (waits until it is back)
  panic:why          a panic, to try what a crash leaves (waits until back)

Needs pyserial (pip install pyserial). Without --port, the X4 is found by
its USB id.
