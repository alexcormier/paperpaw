"""Writes the notices that every copy of PaperPaw must carry, from the
lockfiles: NOTICE at the top of the repository, and the licences the app
shows (Settings, About PaperPaw), one file for the firmware of the Xteink
readers (plugins/about/licences-firmware.md) and one for the apps
(Android, the desktop emulator, the web emulator:
plugins/about/licences-app.md).

What ships is read with `cargo metadata`, per shipped target, following
normal dependencies only (no build scripts, proc macros or dev
dependencies): the firmware's workspace (shells/xteink) and the store
plugins with code (tools/plugin-files) for the readers' chips, the root
workspace's shells for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and the web. Each
third-party crate is listed under the licence it is used under (MIT where
it offers it), with the copyright lines of its licence files (or its
authors, where they hold none); each licence's text follows once.
PaperPaw's own crates are PaperPaw's (LICENSE). What is no crate (fonts,
icons, hyphenation patterns, Mbed TLS, ESP-IDF's libraries, the FreeInk
and OpenX4 code) is in tools/licences/NOTICE.in, by hand.

    python tools/licences/build.py           # writes them
    python tools/licences/build.py --check   # fails where they are not
                                             # what the lockfiles say (CI)

The texts keep their words; in the app's files their lines are joined
into paragraphs, so the reader sets them like a book.
