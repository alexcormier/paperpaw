//! Buttons alone: every screen a plugin adds can be reached and closed
//! with the device's buttons, and the focus visits all there is on it.
//!
//! It runs on every profile looked at that has buttons and no touch
//! screen (the X4s; `two-buttons` if asked for; once for profiles with
//! the same buttons and screen size), and checks, for every screen the
//! plugins looked at add:
//!
//! - `reach.unreachable`: it could not be reached from the home screen
//!   with the buttons alone. A screen a setting offers among its choices
//!   (a mode of the sleep screen, shown in that one's place) is reached
//!   through that setting instead: a note (`reach.chosen`) says which.
//! - `reach.no-close`: back (the button, or what stands for it on a
//!   device without one), pressed up to five times (a folder at a time),
//!   neither closes it, nor brings the home screen, nor asks whether to
//!   leave.
//! - `reach.focus-skips`: moving the focus with the buttons that move it
//!   (left, right, the page buttons; each pressed in every place the
//!   focus goes, a keyboard's rows and columns too) leaves a row, button,
//!   switch or slider out (one inside a row counts with the row), or no
//!   focus is shown at all where there are several.
//! - `reach.focus-trap`: the focus stops on a part and none of these
//!   buttons moves it on, while there are other parts.
//! - `reach.undescribed`: a screen describes no parts, but a forward
//!   button changes a small part of it, as a focus moving would: what is
//!   on it cannot be followed (nor read aloud).
//!
//! On touch screens, for the screens that open without parameters, a
//! note (`reach.touch-label`) where a tap by a part's text, as flows and
//! recordings name parts (`tap-on:`), lands on another part.
//!
//! Each finding comes with a picture of the screen.
//!
//! # The search
//!
//! What the device shows is known from the screen shown and the parts it
//! describes (`Kernel::described_active`: rows, buttons, switches,
//! sliders with their texts, and which has the focus). A *view* is a
//! screen with its parts, wherever in the app it is; the search goes
//! breadth first through the views, from the home screen:
//!
//! 1. On a view newly seen every button is pressed once, short and long
//!    (the power button aside, and the backward one of each pair, left
//!    beside right, page back beside page forward: going round reaches
//!    the same).
//! 2. Then the focus is moved through it with each forward button
//!    (right, down, page forward), one press after the other, and on
//!    each part it reaches confirm is pressed (on a device without
//!    confirm, the long presses).
//! 3. What comes up that was not seen is searched in turn: the menus,
//!    the tools, the settings, and screens that others open with
//!    parameters, when confirm on one of their rows opens them.
//!
//! Views are searched in the order they were seen, but a screen that
//! was searched in the same place (over the same screen) already, with
//! other parts (another group of settings), waits until the screens in
//! new places are (the menu over the reader, the tools under the main
//! menu). The search ends when every screen it looks for is found, when
//! [`Limits::idle`] views in a row brought no screen not seen before, or
//! at [`Limits::views`]. To go on from a view the device is brought
//! there the cheapest way: back from what a press opened, the opposite
//! of a press that moved the focus, one press on from the part before,
//! else home and the way pressed again (in a fresh session if what was
//! pressed changed the way, e.g. a setting).
//!
//! It looks for the screens that open without parameters and stay
//! (notices that go by themselves are left out). One not found is a
//! warning, as the search is bounded and some ways need data the sample
//! library has not; its picture shows it opened directly. One that
//! needs parameters and was not found is noted (`reach.not-reached`).
//! Closing and the focus are checked on the screens reached.
