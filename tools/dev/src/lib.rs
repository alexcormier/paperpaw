//! `paperpaw-dev`: checks a PaperPaw plugin before it is published, and
//! PaperPaw's own plugins while they are made.
//!
//! It runs the real kernel with the standard app in the emulator
//! (`shells/desktop`, headless, with its device profiles) and looks at
//! what the plugin adds: every screen and widget drawn on every device, in
//! light and dark, in each language and look, put on contact sheets; what
//! is drawn checked (text cut or overflowing, parts outside their cell,
//! uneven margins, touch targets too small, focus not shown, contrast on
//! black-and-white screens); its texts (missing translations, a
//! pseudo-language that finds text too long, settings without help, ids
//! outside its namespace, dashes); its behaviour (scripted flows, every
//! screen reachable and closable with buttons alone, no storage reads
//! while drawing, time and heap against the X4's budgets); its package
//! (a data plugin as the device installer and the website take it, a
//! `.ppn` file's header and signature); and snapshots to compare with.
//!
//! What it checks:
//!
//! - PaperPaw's own plugins: `cargo run -p paperpaw-dev -- check --plugin
//!   widgets` (the standard app has them all).
//! - A plugin with code, in its own repository: a few lines that add it
//!   to the app (see [`main`]) run as an example or a test.
//! - A data plugin: `paperpaw-dev check path/to/folder`.
//! - A code plugin built for a device: `paperpaw-dev package plugin.ppn`.
//!
//! Everything ends up in a report (text on the console, `report.html`
//! and `report.json` in the output folder, `target/paperpaw-dev` unless
//! `--out` says otherwise); errors make the run fail, for CI.
