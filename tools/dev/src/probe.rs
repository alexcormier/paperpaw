//! The tool's own plugin in the app: a widget that draws nothing and
//! notes the area it is given, so that checks know a widget's cell
//! exactly (the grid gives every widget of a size the same area); and a
//! screen that notes the settings' descriptions their rows would cut
//! ([`HELP`]), measured with the device's own letters.
//!
//! Sessions add it besides the plugins being checked (see [`add`]); the
//! checks leave its namespace, [`PLUGIN`], out.
//!
//! What it keeps is the thread's: a session builds and runs its devices
//! on one thread, and sessions on other threads (tests run side by side)
//! must not change which plugins a device gets or the area it notes.
