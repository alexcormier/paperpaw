Before tagging, check:
  - cargo test -p paperpaw-x4 (tests/updates.rs: every table, first flash,
    two updates, a failed trial) and cargo test -p paperpaw-sign pass;
  - the release's "Updates have somewhere to go" step (check-image) is
    still run for every device;
  - an update from the last release to this build installs, runs its
    trial and is kept, on a device of each chip (ESP32-C3, ESP32-S3),
    with an image made as the release makes it (no feature remote).
