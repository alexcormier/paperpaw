"""Writes, from crates/paperpaw-table/shared.list, the index of the
firmware's shared function tables (crates/paperpaw-table/src/index.rs)
the signature of every entry (crates/paperpaw-table/table.sig), the
firmware's addresses of them (crates/paperpaw-sdk/src/shared_table.rs), as
the `shared!` declarations in the crates' sources give them, and a digest
of each entry's body and of the functions of its crate it calls
(crates/paperpaw-table/table.body): `--check` fails where a body changed
and the digests were not written anew in the same commit, so that every
change plugins built before would run shows (ADR 0026).

    python3 tools/shared-table.py           # writes both files
    python3 tools/shared-table.py --check   # fails where one is not current
    python3 tools/shared-table.py --appended-to OLD.list
        # fails unless this list is OLD.list (the last released one) with
        # entries appended at a higher revision of their family

It also checks the list's rules: entries are only appended, each at a
revision of its family not below the lines before it (a batch of entries
shares one revision, until the list is released: then every entry appended
needs a revision above the released list's, see `--appended-to`: a plugin
built with the new entry says that revision, and firmware that has it
only at the old one would call past the end of its table), and every entry is declared by exactly one `shared!` (and every
`shared!` is listed). `cargo test -p paperpaw-sdk --test interface`
checks that the blessed list and signatures (interface/) are a prefix
of these.
