"""Whether each of PaperPaw's own plugins the store offers (plugins.txt)
that changed since the last release has a newer version of its own:
devices update a plugin only to a newer version, so a fix under the
same one would never reach them.

    python3 tools/plugin-files/versions.py [<since>]

<since> is the release's tag compared with, the newest `v<version>` tag
before HEAD where not given (CI runs it with the history and the tags).
A plugin updated alone (a tag `<id>-v<version>`, store-plugin.yml) is
compared with those releases too: a change none of them had, under a
version no newer than the newest of them, fails, and so does a version
older than one published.
A plugin's files are `plugins/<id>/` and its binary here
(`src/bin/<id>.rs`). A change no reader sees (a comment, a test, a
rename inside) keeps the version when each commit with it says so in a
trailer of its message:

    Plugin-unchanged: <id>, <id>      (or `all`)

The release rebuilds such a plugin anyway, for its firmware, at the
version it has.

Where the plugin interface was raised since the release
(`native::INTERFACE`), every plugin needs a newer version, changed or
not: its code built before does not run on the new firmware, and devices
fetch the new build only as an update.

The data plugins of data.toml are held to the same: one whose builder or
inputs changed since the release needs a newer version in data.toml (or
the trailer in each commit no reader sees). They have no code, so a
raised interface leaves them as they are.
