"""Whether each of PaperPaw's own plugins the store offers (plugins.txt)
that changed since the last release has a newer version of its own:
devices update a plugin only to a newer version, so a fix under the
same one would never reach them.

    python3 tools/plugin-files/versions.py [<since>] [--release]

<since> is the release's tag compared with, the newest `v<version>` tag
before HEAD where not given (CI runs it with the history and the tags).
A plugin updated alone (a tag `<id>-v<version>`, store-plugin.yml) is
compared with those releases too: a change none of them had, under a
version no newer than the newest of them, fails, and so does a version
older than one published.
A plugin's files are `plugins/<id>/` and its binary here
(`src/bin/<id>.rs`). A change no reader sees (a comment, a test, a
rename inside) keeps the version when each commit with it says so in a
trailer of its message:

    Plugin-unchanged: <id>, <id>      (or `all`)

The release rebuilds such a plugin anyway, for its firmware, at the
version it has.

The plugins built into the firmware (every other crate of `plugins/` that
is published) are held to the version of the release too, but the other
way: crates.io keeps the sources of a published version, so any change in
`plugins/<id>/` since the release (a comment, a test, a rename included;
`Plugin-unchanged:` does not apply) needs a newer version before the
crates are published (docs/releases.md). That is a warning, so that the
bump can be made once, when the beta's changes are in; with `--release`
(the step before the release's version bump) it fails.

Where the plugin interface was raised since the release
(`native::INTERFACE`), every plugin needs a newer version, changed or
not: its code built before does not run on the new firmware, and devices
fetch the new build only as an update.

The data plugins of data.toml are held to the same: one whose builder or
inputs changed since the release needs a newer version in data.toml (or
the trailer in each commit no reader sees). They have no code, so a
raised interface leaves them as they are.

Built store files (`--bytes`, the release's check):

    python3 tools/plugin-files/versions.py --release --bytes

Source commits cannot say what changes a built file: the SDK library and
the built-in plugin crates are no part of `plugins/<id>/`, and a bump
ripples (a plugin that reads another's version is rebuilt with it). So the
check builds the store files of the release's tag (once; kept in
`$PAPERPAW_STORE_BASELINE`, `~/.cache/paperpaw/store-baseline` where not
set) and of HEAD, with build.sh, and fails for each plugin whose version
did not change but whose file did: a store would serve other code under
the same version. The message names it and its next patch version.
Files built for another firmware (the fingerprint, the plugin interface
or the compiler of the two differ) cannot be compared; the version rules
above hold for those (a raised interface: every plugin has a newer
version). `--built <dir>` takes HEAD's files from a build already made
(`build.sh <device> <dir>`, unsigned), `--baseline <dir>` the release's;
`--device` is the device they are built for (x4, where not given).

A commit that changed a data plugin's inputs without changing what the
build writes, and that is in shared history (its message cannot take the
trailer any more), is listed in unchanged.txt: its hash and the plugins,
and the proof (the build's output compared with the release's) as a
comment.
