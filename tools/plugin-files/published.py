"""A plugin's version is published once: the files of PaperPaw's own
store plugins a release built, against those its releases published
before under the same names (`<id>-<version>-<device>.ppn`, the folder
`<id>-<version>.zip`), as GitHub lists them:

    gh api --paginate --slurp repos/<owner>/<repo>/releases > releases.json
    python3 tools/plugin-files/published.py files <dir> releases.json
    python3 tools/plugin-files/published.py folders <dir> releases.json

`files`, before catalogue.py: a file of a version published before, for
the same chip, firmware fingerprint and compiler, is taken as published
(its bytes, so a release never offers other bytes under a version that
has them); one for another fingerprint (the plugin interface changed) is
a new build of that version and stays. `folders`, after catalogue.py: a
folder of a version published before must be the same bytes, else it
fails (versions.py keeps a plugin that changed from its old version).
