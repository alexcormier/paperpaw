"""What store-plugin.yml checks before it builds one of PaperPaw's own code
plugins between releases:

    store_update.py <plugin> <base-tag> --source <dir> [--accept <path>,<path>...]

Run from a trusted checkout of the workflow's own commit
(`github.workflow_sha`), never from the source it checks: the source is
the branch to publish, and its own copy of this script, like its
fingerprint check and its signing, would be the branch's to change.
<dir> is a checkout of the source (`HEAD`), with the base's tag fetched.
It prints the plugin's version (its own, its manifest's) on
standard output and fails, saying why on standard error, when

- the source is not a descendant of the base's tag (a branch made from it);
- the plugin is in the base (an update): its version is not above the
  base's. A plugin that is not in the base (a new one, first published
  between releases) needs no older version to compare with;
- the source differs from the base's anywhere but in the plugin, the
  plugin files' project (`tools/plugin-files/`: its manifest, lock file,
  list and binaries, no scripts), the CHANGELOG and docs: anything else
  (the kernel, the SDK, the shells, other plugins, `crates/`, any script
  or workflow) is firmware, or what a firmware shares with a plugin (the
  tables of shared functions), or what runs with the key, and the
  published firmware is the base's, not this source's. A path can be
  accepted by name (`--accept`, a path or a folder, each one reported):
  a decision of whoever runs the workflow. The root `Cargo.toml` may
  gain the plugin's member and its entry of workspace.dependencies and
  nothing else ([patch], [profile.*] or another dependency would build
  the plugin against another SDK); `Cargo.lock` may gain the plugin's own
  package (and a dependency on it) and no existing package changes, and no
  new paperpaw-* package or one from git or a registry. Git's
  rename detection is off, so a moved file shows both its paths;
- the plugin depends by path on anything but another crate of the
  workspace (a copy of the SDK in its own folder).

With `--main` (the source is the repository's main, #171): the same, except
that a change elsewhere since the base is no refusal but a note (main moves on
with the next firmware; what a plugin may use of it is the firmware's table,
whose fingerprint check_files.sh holds the files to), and Cargo.toml and
Cargo.lock may differ too. The plugin must still come from a descendant of the
base's tag, have a newer version, and depend on no copy of the SDK.

The plugin's fingerprint is not checked here: check_files.sh does, with
the build's files, before they are signed.
