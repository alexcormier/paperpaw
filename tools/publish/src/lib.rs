//! A plugin's repository checked by the rules of the plugin store at
//! paperpaw.org before it is published, so that a release the site would
//! refuse is never made: `paperpaw-dev check-publish` and
//! `paperpaw-sign check-publish` (which the release workflow of
//! `tools/dev/templates` runs before it releases anything).
//!
//! The rules are the site's own, in one file ([`rules`],
//! `store-rules.json`): the groups, the limits of names, texts, tags and
//! screenshots, what a plugin's folder may hold, the sizes of builds and
//! sources, the readers. The site serves the same file
//! (`/api/v1/store-rules.json`), so a check can take the newest rules, and
//! PaperPaw's CI compares the two.
//!
//! - [`repo::check`]: the repository as it is: `plugin.ini`,
//!   `store/store.ini`, the screenshots, the folder's files, a plugin with
//!   code's `Cargo.lock` and source, the release workflow and its switches.
//! - [`release::check`]: the files a release would carry, as the site reads
//!   them from GitHub: their names (`<id>-<version>.zip`,
//!   `<id>-<version>-<device>.ppn`), each build's chip, plugin interface
//!   and signature, one key for all, the sizes, and the tag.
//!
//! Each [`Problem`] says what is wrong and what to change, in plain words.
