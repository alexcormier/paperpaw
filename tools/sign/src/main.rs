paperpaw-sign: sign PaperPaw firmware updates, make and sign native plugins

USAGE:
    paperpaw-sign key <secret-key-file>
        Makes a new signing key, keeps it in the file (keep it safe) and
        prints its public key.
    paperpaw-sign sign <image.bin> <update.bin> [--key <secret-key-file>]
        Signs an app image (`espflash save-image`, not merged) as an update
        file. Without --key, the key comes from PAPERPAW_SIGNING_KEY (64
        hexadecimal digits).
    paperpaw-sign show <update.bin>
        Shows what the update holds, its signer, and whether its signature
        holds.
    paperpaw-sign sign-apart <flash.bin> <flash.bin.sig> [--key <secret-key-file>]
        Signs a whole flash image (as the web flasher writes it) with a
        signature file of its own; the key as for sign.
    paperpaw-sign check <flash.bin> <flash.bin.sig>
        Shows the signer of a whole flash image and whether its signature
        holds.
    paperpaw-sign sign-asset <file> <file.sig> [--key <secret-key-file>]
        Signs a release asset (an emulator, the handbook) with a signature
        file of its own, over \"paperpaw-asset-v1\" and a line end before the
        file: it never holds as a firmware's; the key as for sign.
    paperpaw-sign check-asset <file> <file.sig>
        Shows the signer of a release asset and whether its signature
        holds.
    paperpaw-sign plugins <image.bin>
        Lists the plugin crates an app image or update file has built in;
        fails if it lists none.
    paperpaw-sign fingerprint <firmware.elf>
        Prints the fingerprint native plugins must have to run on a
        firmware (16 hexadecimal digits), as its ELF file names it.
    paperpaw-sign pack <plugin.elf> <plugin.ppn> [--key <secret-key-file>]
        Makes a native plugin file from a plugin linked with
        paperpaw-plugin.x and --emit-relocs, or says what keeps it from
        moving (writable data, undefined symbols, addresses built into
        instructions, relative reaches out of the plugin). With --key,
        signs it as sign-plugin does.
    paperpaw-sign plugin <plugin.ppn>
        Shows what a plugin file holds, and its author if it is signed
        (failing if the signature does not hold).
    paperpaw-sign sign-plugin <plugin.ppn> [--key <secret-key-file>]
        Signs a plugin file as its author: the signature goes at its end
        (one it had is replaced), and the author's key (64 hexadecimal
        digits) is printed, as the plugin library names it; the key as for
        sign. The signature is paperpaw-native's: Ed25519 over \"PaperPaw
        plugin file\", a zero byte, the file and the trailer's start.
    paperpaw-sign check-plugin <plugin.ppn>
        Shows the author of a plugin file and whether the signature holds;
        fails if it is not signed.
    paperpaw-sign check-publish [repo] [--release-dir <dir>] [--tag <tag>] [--rules <file>]
        Checks a plugin's repository by the rules of the plugin store at
        paperpaw.org, and with --release-dir the files of its release (their
        names, each build's chip, interface and signature); fails where the
        site would refuse it, and says what to change. --rules takes the
        site's newest rules (https://paperpaw.org/api/v1/store-rules.json).
        paperpaw-dev check-publish is the same check.
    paperpaw-sign store-rules [file]
        Prints the store's rules this tool checks by; with a file (the
        site's), fails where they differ.
    paperpaw-sign statics <crate.rlib>...
        Lists the symbols in writable memory (mutable statics) of the
        objects in rlibs (built without LTO); fails if there is one. A
        native plugin has no writable data, so the SDK's crates must keep
        none.
